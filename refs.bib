  abstract = {A central tenet of information visualization research and practice is the notion of visual variable effectiveness, or the perceptual precision at which values are decoded given visual channels of encoding. Formative work from Cleveland \& McGill has shown that position along a common axis is the most effective visual variable for comparing individual values. One natural conclusion is that any chart that is not a dot plot or scatterplot is deficient and should be avoided. In this paper we refute a caricature of this "scatterplots only" argument as a way to call for new perspectives on how information visualization is researched, taught, and evaluated.},

Increasing our basic understanding of graphical perception will allow us to make graphs that convey quantitative information to viewers with more accuracy and efficiency. This paper describes an experiment that was conducted to investigate the accuracy of six basic judgments of graphical perception. Two types of position judgments were found to be the most accurate, length judgments were second, angle and slope judgments were third, and area judgments were last. Distance between judged objects was found to be a factor in the accuracy of the basic judgments.},

From these studies a paradigm that has important applications for practice has begun to emerge.

The methodology that can be invoked to study graphical perception is illustrated by an investigation of the shape parameter of a two-variable graph, a topic that has had much discussion, but little scientific study, for at least 70 years.},

  abstract = {Bar charts are one of the most common visualization types. In a classic graphical perception paper, Cleveland \& McGill studied how different bar chart designs impact the accuracy with which viewers can complete simple perceptual tasks. They found that people perform substantially worse on stacked bar charts than on aligned bar charts, and that comparisons between adjacent bars are more accurate than between widely separated bars. However, the study did not explore why these differences occur. In this paper, we describe a series of follow-up experiments to further explore and explain their results. While our results generally confirm Cleveland \& McGill's ranking of various bar chart configurations, we provide additional insight into the bar chart reading task and the sources of participants' errors. We use our results to propose new hypotheses on the perception of bar charts.},

  abstract = {Graphical representations have to be true to the data they display. Computational tools ensure this on a technical level. But we also need to take ``flaws'' of the human perceptual system into account. The sine illusion provides an example where human perception leads to systematic bias in the assessment of the optical stimulus, with a particularly notable impact on perception of time-series data with a seasonal component. In this article, we discuss the reasons for the illusion and various strategies useful to break the illusion or reduce its strength. We demonstrate the presence of the illusion in real-world and theoretical situations. We also present data from a user study, which demonstrate the dramatic effect the sine illusion can have on conclusions drawn from displayed data.},

  abstract = {Abstract Embellishing simple graphs by adding perspective, 'the 3D look, has become increasingly commonplace with the ready availability of graphics software. However, the effect of adding such decorative depth on the comprehension and recall of the graph's message has received little attention. The present study evaluated performance on such common graphical formats as line graphs, bar charts and pie charts constructed with and without the 3D look. When subjects were asked to make relative magnitude estimations, only the 3D line graphs resulted in reliable performance decrements. Likewise, information presented in 3D line graphs was remembered less accurately than information presented in 2D line graphs. For the estimation of global trends, both 3D line graphs and bar charts were used more quickly than 2D formats, but this speed was obtained at the expense of accuracy. For a trend classification task involving more focused processing, 3D line graphs and bar charts were associated with an overall performa...}

Inequalities were presented either before (Experiment 1) or after the graphs (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, irrelevant depth cues were associated with slower decision times and there was no processing cost associated with an inconsistency between the dimensionalities of bars and frames. Memory encoding and retrieval times in Experiment 2 were affected by both graph complexity and consistency. Neither a depth consistency heuristic nor the maximum ink-data ratio principle can account for these results. More appropriate guidance for graph design will come from elaborating the working memory component of current cognitive models of graph processing.

  abstract = {Manipulating the way a graph is drawn influences viewers' ability to extract information from it. In a series of experiments with simple bar graphs, the authors varied the rendering characteristics and relative heights of the bars and asked participants to estimate the quantities portrayed. The addition of 3-dimensional (3D) perspective depth cues lowered accuracy. This accuracy disadvantage diminished when a short delay was introduced before judgments were reported. The height of the judged bar relative to nearby graphical elements also affected accuracy; this effect was about 1 order of magnitude larger and remained intact when the delay was introduced. Nearby elements also affected viewers' bias (under- or overestimation). These effects do not seem to be due to misestimation of object depth. The results suggest that warnings about accuracy decrements due to 3D shading may be overstated, whereas distortions due to neighboring elements should be of more concern.
