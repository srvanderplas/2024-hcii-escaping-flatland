What elements of experimental design, such as randomization or the use of a control group, do you think were present in the experiment? Why?
-----
I believe every graph was randomized for every student. I also believe the practice was meant to be a bit of the control group.
1. Random assignment of participants to groups receiving different chart ratio orders which distribute order effects

2. Within-subjects design where each person sees all chart types to reduce variability

3. Control group receiving only 2D charts to compare 3D formats to
I think this was controlled because its a survey for students in the stats class, if it were to be randomized it would be for random people. 
I believe that the examples given were randomized each time but the questions in general all followed the same format
Randomization was likely used to yield a large and wide variety of people with little bias toward what the experiment was testing.
The use of randomization and a control group was likely present in the experiment to minimize bias and isolate the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. Randomization helps ensure that groups are comparable, while a control group provides a baseline for comparison, enhancing the experiment's validity.
Randomization was used as participants all received different sets of graphs to examine. A person wasn't assigned to a certain set of graphs and it was up to random chance on which set of graphs they received. 
NA
I believe there we more then just bar graphs
Randomization, shapes were randomized 
The randomization of everyone getting 5 out of 7 of the graphs to randomize what graphs were given the the consumer. 
I think that it's possible for some group of randomly assigned students to compare 2D graphs and another group of students to compare only 3D, and perhaps another group comparing both 2D and 3D graphs. Randomization may have been seen to obtain the most accurate results without any bias or influence.
Randomization was used because the ever person got a different graph. 
I think randomization was used in this experiment, they randomly selected a group of participants to do this study. The experimenter decided it would be more efficient to randomize these participants to get a better idea of the average intelligence.
I think that there is randomization but not a control group in my opinion, because there isn't one group that is left alone or not studied. There is randomization in how people were shown the graph types and random sampling because the survey was put out to students, but they were not required to answer. The random sampling does make it so that others outside of Statistics 218 can take it as well. This helps enlarge the generalizability of the study.
gaps between blocks were used as elements, also dimension was an element all used to make the experiment a little more challenging and intriguing.
People were asked whether or not they wanted to participate so it was voluntary. I personally am not sure if I was in the control group or not so it is blind.
I bet all the same bars were used because its the best way to judge peoples accuracy if they are all the same.
I think that Stat 218 students and are the only ones allowed to participate in the experiment. I think the entire study is randomized with no control group. I think everyone got the same survey, and results of accuracy regarding the smaller bar in the graph will be compared. 
control group. Asked if were above the age of 19 and in stat 218 or related course. It was aimed towards UNL students. 
I believe it would be randomized, as it's being offered to college students with no control over who they may be. A control was presented at the beginning of the survey.
i believe that the use of convienace sampling is used because it is using stats 218 students to its benefit, the control variable would consist of the stats 218 class. 
I think that each participant received random questions from a question pool. 

This is because then each participant has an equal chance of getting the questions correct.  
I think a control could possibly be used if someone was presented with all two-dimensional bar graphs, and others with both two-dimensional and three-dimensional. This could have been used to compare the differences in correct answers between the two dimensions. I think recording which bar graph was smaller sets a good baseline for each response, making sure the person is able to understand which bar is the correct bar to be observing and comparing to. 
Randomization was not used because it was offered as an extra credit assignment in class. There was likely a control group in the experiment otherwise it would be hard to draw conclusions from the data. 
control group would be the symbols representing the words. The randomization would be changing the size of the triangle and the circle
I think that randomization was used in this experiment; the experimenter could have randomized the the different graphs in different orders based on dimension and color. 
I believe the experimental design used in this study could have been the use of a control group, considering only members of Stat218 were allowed to participate in this study.
I think there was randomization because everyone is going to answer differently and there are females and males. Also from only seeing my results I don't know if everyone is getting the same graphs or different graphs. 
Groups were randomly assigned. There didn't appear to be a control group and students were randomly assigned after demographics were collected. A control group wasn't necessary because everything was based on how someone perceived something.
The researchers told us at the start of the experiment that there is a lot of randomization used in the experiment. I think the reason for that is because it allows for a lot of different results and perspectives to be researched. 
I think that they probably had a control group where all the bars were essentially the same and they probably had a lot of randomization in what order the graphs were presented. But randomization in sample size probably isn't there because it's all stats 218 students completing an assignment.
Randomization was definitely involved since this was offered to all STAT 218 students who were able to choose their involvement. This population is also large as there are multiple sections to this course. I am not sure if there is a control group however, the control may be the correct answer to each question in the survey. Therefore, how far off from the correct answer may be measured and used to observe how well students are able to perceive statistical graphics. 
I believe that there is a control group and random assignment. This is a double-blind study so as to not cause any bias. This experiment gets a random selection sample by volunteering participants. The researchers could use random assignment as to what participants see what pairs of graphs and in what order.
The use of a control group was present since only STATS 218 students were the ones who took the survey, so there could be more knowledge of interpreting data compared to the general population. 
I think the randomization factor would be that the people participating are random. I think the control factor would be that everyone is. taking the test on their computer. Something that could be different is the order of the questions. This is the case because the researcher does not decide who is taking the test. He just gets their results without worrying who the person was that took the test. The only information the researcher knows is the persons favorite zoo animal, age, and level of education.
They used randomization through the test, providing the users taking the survey with random bar charts that were examined. 
I think that it was randomized because anyone could take it. The controlled group was the pictures that were shown to us.
it was randomized, sure students choose to complete this survey but i would still say its a random group of students.
I think that each person was assigned different bar graphs in different orders but whether the subject was a stat 218 student or not was known because we were asked and the test seemed randomly generated 
there was a use of random graphs (to me) and colors presented to me, I also think they could have been put in a random order for each person doing the experiment. 

the treatment group would be the STAT 218 students participating in this experiment

I think the control group would be the people who did not choose to do this study, because for this case you either had to do the experiment or you did not do it. 

random selection of results could also be used to compare each persons answers
