If you had to hear about this study using only the extended abstract or only the presentation, which one would you prefer? Which one would be better for determining whether the experiment was well designed?
-----
The presentation. This is because the abstract feels much less personable and easier to follow. The abstract is probably better with determining whether the experiment was well designed
Again I like the presentation better mostly because it adds a more personal touch! The abstract is probably really the best was to understand the design of the experiment. However I struggle reading that kind of material. So for a participant, the video presentation was the best. 
I prefer the presentation because it is able to cover mor specifics and limitations to the study. However, I believe the extended abstract went more into detail about the specific experiment performed and would be better to determine how well it was designed.
Presentation, because it would provide more information than the abstract. 

Presentation 
An extended abstract typically provides a more comprehensive written overview of the study, including details on the research question, methodology, data collection, analysis, and results. It often includes references and citations to related literature, which can help in assessing the study's context and the soundness of the research design. This format allows for a more in-depth and critical examination of the study's methodology and the quality of the data and analysis.

Presentations, on the other hand, are often limited by time constraints and may focus more on summarizing key findings and implications, potentially leaving out some of the finer details of the research design. They are valuable for providing a quick overview and for engaging an audience, but they may not offer the same level of depth and scrutiny as an extended abstract.

So, if the goal is to determine whether an experiment was well designed, the extended abstract is usually the better choice for a more comprehensive and detailed assessment of the research methodology and its rigor. However, combining both the presentation and the extended abstract can provide a more complete understanding of the study.
I would rather hear the presentation because it gave more information with more visuals. It allowed for time to talk about the results as well as the future progressions of the study. 
I would prefer hearing about the study using the abstract. I believe it provides more detail on the setup of the experiment, which is better for determining if it was well designed.
I would prefer the presentation because it is easier for me to understand. The extended abstract would be better for looking at the design of the experiment. 
I would definitely prefer the presentation because of how the information is broken down into slides. However, an extended abstract has a lot more to be picked through to determine if the experiment is designed well. 
If I had to choose between hearing about the study using only the extended abstract or only the presentation to determine whether the experiment was well designed, I would prefer the extended abstract.

The extended abstract is typically a more detailed and structured written document that provides a comprehensive summary of the research methodology, key findings, and conclusions. It is designed to convey the essential aspects of the study in a concise manner, making it easier to scrutinize the study's design and key components.

While presentations can be engaging and informative, they often focus on summarizing key findings and may not provide as much detail on the study's design and methodology. In a presentation, the emphasis is often on delivering a clear message to a live audience, which may not delve deeply into the study's design nuance
I personally would prefer the presentation. Compared to the abstract reading an abundance of information, it is more difficult to grasp the material. 
Personally, I would've preferred the presentation as it gave a simple explanation about the experiment and what the goal of the experiment was. It gave details to what the research question was about and how the experiment was set up to find out answers to the research question. 
I would prefer a presentation. I am more of a visual person and not interactive. I feel like the presentation would give a better insight on how the experiment was deigned. 
I would prefer the full conference presentation over just the extended abstract. The presentation would provide much more detail that would help me better evaluate the experimental design.
I would want to hear about this study with only the presentation. That way, I don't feel as left in the dark about what I'm about to do and why I'm doing it. Overall, because the presentation goes more in depth, I think it would be better for determining if the experiment was designed well.
I would like to have heard about this from the presentation over the extended abstract. However I think that the extended abstract was more informational and provided us with more background information. 
I would prefer the presentation only. Although I think that the extended abstract would be better for determining whether the experiment was well designed. 
I personally would prefer the extended abstract because it provides exactly what the experiment is trying to study, with extra information on how it connects to the Cleveland and McGill experiment, and how the limitations are being met. I think the extended abstract is better for determining whether the experiment is well-designed. While the presentation provides an overview of 3D background and scale, I believe that the extended abstract provides more in-depth and beneficial information for the participant to accurately navigate around the limitations that the study may have between 2D and 3D graphs. 
If I had to hear about this study using only one source, I would prefer the video presentation. This may be because I am a visual and auditory learner, but I also had a hard time understanding what the researchers wanted us to get out of the abstract because it was so complex. With the presentation, I was able to understand step by step how the study was conducted. 
I would much rather prefer the presentation again because of the visuals and the ability to have someone else explain it. When determining whether the experiment was well designed or not you would certainly have to look at the abstract and all its information.
Personally i would choose the abstract just because i enjoy reading more than watching a presentaion, but as far as the infromation goes the abstract gives a brief, but well informed summary of the study. 
I would prefer the presentation because it used more visuals and I like videos better than reading. But I think the the extended abstract contained more information about the design.
I would prefer the presentation over the extended abstract. I think the presentation was all around more informative, easier to understand, and would be better for determining whether the experiment was well designed. Having a lot of backup information to support the experiment kept my interest and spiked my overall support for the conduction of the experiment. 
I liked the presentation, due to the fact that it was explained through live presentation. I think this allows me to follow along much easier. 
I would prefer the presentation as it's more in-depth and provides a visual rather than the extended abstract. I also think the presentation would be better for determining whether the experiment was well designed for the same reason, it provides a visual for a visual study.  
I would choose to only hear about this study through the presentation. It provides much better detail about how the experiment was performed and where the idea for the experiment came from. It also included many more visuals that were very useful in understanding the study procedure. 
I would say the presentation would be better to hear about, but if you were determining whether the experiment was well designed, I would rather hear the extended abstract. 
If I had to choose to hear about this study based on the extended abstract it only the presentation, I think I would prefer the extended abstract. I felt that the presentation almost made the study a little more confusing, and I like that the extended abstract is something that I was able to read on my won time at my own pace. I also feel that the abstract represents that the experiment was better designed compared tot he presentation, the abstract divides up the experiments and and explains the different sections in a more easy to understand fashion. 
I would prefer the presentation better because it was someone talking and telling me the information. The presentation was also put together in a way that was easy to understand. The extended abstract would be better for how well the experiment was designed because it tells how the original study was put together. 
The think I would prefer the presentation. I thought that the presentation explained things very well and kept me interested in what was happening in the experiment. I think that the presentation would also be better for determining if the experiment was well designed. 
I think I would have preferred hearing the presentation because I found it a lot more engaging than the abstract. I think the presentation language was also a lot more digestible and used general public-friendly language the abstract was more technical. I think the abstract is still more helpful for determining how well-designed the experiment was though, since it answered questions I had after the presentation. 
I guess I would perceive that this study would have more relevance to the presentation as it makes me believe that this experiment is much more applicable in helping researchers learn how to teach better classes than helping the visually impaired.
I prefered the presentation as it provided more visuals for me to understand and broke down each part of the experiment in more detail. I believe the delivery of the presentation was more geared towards those who have little understanding in statistics and I was able to observe how the experiment was designed and why. I appreciated having someone explain what each graph is and the purpose of this study and the Cleveland and McGill study.
I would prefer the presentation since I see how different the data would be when comparing bars that are in a 3-D graph and a 2-D graph. The extended abstract however provided clearer details and information about the study. This would be better when determining how well the experiment was designed. I say this because we are able to look closer at how each of the graphs was manipulated. 
I think I would rather hear the presentation because it is easy to follow and understand. The presentation is laid out very well, and it is in a good order. Sometimes reading long articles can be hard to follow and understand. 
I would prefer hearing about it through the presentation. This made a lot more sense to me than reading the abstract and it also included the results. The abstract would be better for determining if the experiment was well designed because it goes into depth.
I would prefer the prestentation because i am a visual all learner and would rather watch a video than read an article. I retain it a little better and i can always go back and rewatch if im confused. 
I would prefer the presentation. I think that maybe the abstract would be better for determining whether the design of the experiment was better because of the fact that it strictly lays out the experiment and some of what math was involved, whereas even though the presentation did that, it went more in depth about the results as well instead of just the design. 
If I had to hear about this study I would prefer the presentation because the visual components of results helped me to better understand. However, I feel that the extended abstract provides better information for determining if the experiment was well designed because it better explains the study being replicated.
