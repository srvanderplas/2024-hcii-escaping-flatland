What components were emphasized in the presentation that weren't emphasized in the abstract? Why do you think that is?
-----
The actual purpose of the study, which is to look for discrepancies in the ratios between 2d and 3d bars. This is probably because the abstract went into much more detail on the math involved.
The presentation talked alot about the fact that there wasn't as much of a difference between the dimensional graphs when it came to the observations. At least not as much of a difference as was expected when they developed the experiment. I always think that the abstract is just that - an abstract writing about the facts. They are always hard for me to understand, so I liked the video presentation. It made it easier for me to understand the results as well and the idea behind the research from the beginning. 
The difference in users (novice vs people that are familiar with reading graphs) in perception of the different graphs more emphasized in the video. Different components of the audience in general were more addressed in the presentation.
One of the things that was talked about was that the graphs were randomly assigned in order and from there they followed kind of an order. This was probably the case because they wanted an accurate version of the data
The difference between the ratios and whether the graphs were adjacent or separated. I think this is because it is a deeper question than the original research question. It is another variable rather than the answer to our research question. 
The results of the study were focused in the video rather than the abstract. They found that there was no statistical difference between the 3-dimension projections versus the 2-dimension. They also found that participants underestimated their guesses more when looking at 3D. In the video, they focused on the future of the study as well. 
I think the design of the graphs themselves as well as the reasoning of the experiment were covered in more detail in the presentation than the abstract. This may be because the presentation is an explanation of the study for people who've taken it, while the abstract focuses on other scientists.
It gave more details about how the experiment actually works and how it's conducted. The presentation was made to be that way so that the general public could understand it better.
The future of the study/work at hand was emphasized more in the presentation because it's more timely. The abstract focused on what was going on in the study rather than the future. 
Presentations emphasize visual aids, verbal explanations, audience engagement, key takeaways, and contextualization. This emphasis is to make the research more engaging and understandable for a live audience, whereas abstracts provide a concise written summary.
Some components that were emphasized in the presentation that were not emphasized in the abstract would be that the 2D graphs are a lot easier to compare compared to the 3D images. I think this is because ones mind can be very overwhelmed looking at the 3D images. 
The presentation emphasized the questionnaire and how it was set up to solve a certain research question. The abstract gave us a more detailed explanation about the overall experiment and how graphs set created for the questionnaire. The abstract goes into the detail about the whole experiment while the presentation focused mostly on the questionnaire. 
I feel like components like replicating weren't emphasized. I say this because there was no real focus. After doing it, it was hard for me to understand. 
The abstract focuses on high-level motivation and methods, while the presentation provided more details on the design considerations around minimizing distortion and precisely replicating prior work. There were also 15 treatment conditions per participant, which is a key experimental design detail not mentioned in the abstract. 

I assume this is due to the nature of an abstract and its purpose; it's a shorter introduction to any given study/results, doesn't include visuals, and shouldn't include results when trying to get the study published.
A lot more about the original study was emphasized in the video. I think the purpose of an abstract is to provide a short, but conclusive summary about the study, and at that point, just referencing what the study was based off of was keeping it short and simple for participants.
The components that were emphasized in this presentation were the experiment as a whole within this presentation. We got more background information in the presentation than in the abstract. 
The abstract did not have as much detail about the study as a whole. I think that was mainly because abstracts are generally used as small details about results instead of the experiement altogether. 
I think that in the presentation the "background on 3D graphics" was emphasized more compared to the abstract. I think it is heavily emphasized in the presentation because it is likely easier to analyze present results with possible 3D graph limitations. In the abstract the researchers talk about limitations that can occur within the study, but more on limitations that needed to be corrected from the Cleveland and McGill study. 
A component of the presentation that wasn't emphasized in the abstract is participants were underestimating the true ratio between the larger and smaller graph. I think that this was not emphasized in the abstract because there were no results or conclusion sections. I feel that the abstract had more contents to it but was not provided to us. 
there were tons of visuals in the presentation and i think this is because the abstract is more limited with space and so it is important to put as much information is that space as possible without using many visuals.
In the presentation there was a more in depth look at different graphs and results. For example, there was an elaborated graph on the different true ratios in the study.
Components in the presentation not in the abstract include the stats departments participation and their predicted responses for true ratios. I think that is because the sample size was small and it was more used as a test run.
I think the purpose of the extended abstract was to be straight to the point and informative of the experiment itself. The presentation goes a lot more in depth when defining the purpose of the experiment, the methods, the results, and when giving examples and references.  One thing I noticed that was not in the abstract were the three assumptions that had to be used when attempting to replicate the experiment. I also didn't see results of the study in the abstract. 
I think the design and background was more emphasized in the presentation. 
The presentation emphasizes more on why the graphs are bad and most importantly, how the study is carried out. For example, what methods are being used? While the abstract simply answers why they're doing this study and the study's importance.
They emphasized the physical components of the study. In the presentation he talked about the differences and similarities between the studies they based off of and the actual study performed. He also showed and explained what type of kits were presented to the participants and why. The results and predicted results were also presented in the video. I think this is because the presentation was created after the abstract and the study was performed so they have more data. 
That the graphs aren't the best way to go about this experiment. The graphs could be hard to read and understand. I thi
The presentation gave a background on 3-D graphics, I like how it included the background and went over things such as the development of graphics in Microsoft excel. The presentation went over the results of the study and how those results can be interpreted and used for students experiential learning. 
The thing that I noticed that was most emphasized was different views of a 3D graph. When he talking about it it was nice to hear that they can be viewed in different ways depending on how you look at them. Another thing that stood out to me was UNL ran it through two models to see if they found different results. 
The components emphasized in the presentation were how the researchers were going to use the information from the study. This was probably not emphasized in the abstract because they wanted the results to be as natural as possible and didn't want participants knowing more about the study.
I think the background of why 3D models and 2D models affect perception was a lot more thorough in the presentation in the bar graph. That could also be because I am a very visual learned so seeing multiple graphs was helpful for me while listening to the explanation. I think the abstract was also based on more technical results which is why. 
I believe that one emphasized components in the presentation was the ability to use the data to help understand how to teach the next generation better. In the abstract, I liked the implications of helping the visually impaired.
One of the biggest differences between the presentation and the abstract was the inclusion of the results. The presentation went in depth into the results and how the data was analyzed. The purpose is to give a brief summary of the study and act as an "introduction" to the presentation therefore, the results were not included. Also, I feel like the presentation went in more depth into the Cleveland and McGill experiment for similar reasons. The presentation allows for a more in depth analysis into the study whereas the abstract is a brief summary.
The components that were emphasized were the difference between the 2-D and 3-D graphs and how much smaller the bar is. While the abstract gave more emphasis on the way the graphs were manipulated. I think that it is this way, so the participant isn't paying attention to the angle of view and the distance between bars. 
The fact that the results for the 2D graphs were more accurate than the 3D graphs because they were a lot easier to read because ehe viewing angle can be distorted. I think that this is not mentioned a lot because there were options to take it online or in person, and that can change the results of the experiment. The way you view the graphs on a computer versus in person is very different. 
The 3D and 2D length were emphasized in the presentation. It was also in the abstract but the abstract focused on more than just the length between the circle and triangle.
He went into more of an indepth of why they used 3D graphics and how alot of studies show that 3D graphics aren't the best way to display your data. He also discussed the main problems with using 3D graphics like them not being as accurate as 2D graphics.
In the presentation there was a visualization of each kit that was not in the abstract, they also included many more equations in regard to the math that was involved from the study. I think this is easier to talk about than it is to write about, and are able to explain it more efficiently. Also, in an abstract, there is only a limited amount of information people want to put in there in order to not give all of the study information in the abstract itself. 
Components emphasized in the presentation were the purpose of the study and what was being experimented on. This was likely not emphasized in the abstract to avoid any bias or sway of decisions during the participation process.
