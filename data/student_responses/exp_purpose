What do you think the purpose of the experiment was?
-----
To see if students got progressively inaccurate as the graphs went on
The purpose is to evaluate if different formats of presenting data affects people's accuracy in making comparisons and perceptual judgements based on bar charts.
To see if we could accurately read the 3D printed, 3D, and 2D graphs 
To test how much people perceive the percentage of something to smaller 
To determine how different mediums (3D vs 2D) affect the visualization of data.
When evaluating the experiment in Stat 218, focus on key elements: clear research question, randomization, control group, treatment variables, sample size, data collection, experimental procedure, statistical analysis, ethical considerations, and meaningful conclusions. Assess these aspects to determine the experiment's validity and any potential limitations.

 
The purpose of the experiment was to see if 2D and 3D models can affect the perception of those who are currently looking at the graph. Will 3D graphs make the participant exaggerate the difference in two bars? 
I think the purpose of this experiment was to get a better understanding of where STAT218 students land. 
Reading graphs
I think the purpose of this experiment was to be able to demonstrate how angles alter an individuals perception. 
To see how accurate one can assume the specific height of a ar is to another on the same graph 
I think the purpose was explore how data is interpreted by students and what interpretations/conclusions we can make from graphs.
To understand which bar graphs are easier to determine what is being shown on the graph. 
I think that the purpose of this study was to get a visual on what perspectives people see certain graphs. 
To measure the difference in how well participants analyze data presented in 2D graphs compared to 3D graphs. 
test how accurately we could get the sliders
To see which type of graph is easier to decipher.
To gage students skills at estimating relative size ratios.
I think the purpose of this experiment was to determine how well we can differentiate smaller and larger bars on 3D bar graphs. 
To see if there is a preference when displaying data. Is there a better route to be taking. 
I think the purpose of the experiment was to study differences in size estimation between different visuals representations.
Personally, i can identify that they are separating results based on different age groups, as far as the charts that were involved my only guess in the experiment is that they were studying aproximation within different age groups, the goal is to see how well different age groups can determine approximately how high a certain bar is in conjunction with another.
I think the purpose of this experiment was to explore whether or not participants could determine the size difference between the two bars.  
I think the purpose of this experiment was to determine if bar graphs can be more correctly interpreted in either two-dimensions or three-dimensions.  
To gauge how visual distractions affect perception of size. 
To test how someone measures two variable in front of them 
I think that the importance of this experiment was to determine if visual depths is a limiting factor in peoples ability to correctly distinguish between graphs with different values. 
I believe the purpose of this experiment was to test vision/perception by asking the participant to see which bar is smaller and by how small it is from different perspectives (2D/3D).
To see if we could identify which graph was smaller and by how much by looking at different graphs in different ways. 
To find out if students can identify heights of bars and comparisons in 2D and 3D / also if colors make a difference in what we see.
I think the purpose of this experiment was to see if people who are in a statistics class differ at all from others in this study. Also the study was able to get a larger sample size with people in STATS 218 participating in the study. 
I think the purpose of the experiment was to see whether your perception of the size of the graphs changed based on the size of the bars next to the bars. 
The purpose of this experiment was to measure perception judgement in a population currently in statistics.
I think this experiment was about understanding people perceptions based on size and understanding.
To see how well the general population interprets data between 2-D graphs and 3-D graphs. 
I think the purpose of the experiment is to test people's perception of size when using different shapes. 
To determine if 3D-printed bar charts were easier to interpret and/or affected judgement than 2D bar charts. 
I think the purpose of this experiment was to test if taking statistics makes a person able to differentiate and compare the two bars better than someone not taking stats 218.
To see how student interpret t the question and it there answers change even when the difference in space between bars is the same.
To investigate how different forms of graphs are interpreted by individuals. 
To see how humans are able to perceptualize different graphs
