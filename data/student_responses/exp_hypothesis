What hypotheses might the experimenter have been testing?
-----
Students will get progressively less accurate as questions were asked
3D printed bar charts will lead to more accurate ratio judgments compared to 2D or 3D digital charts.
What is the % difference between the accuracy of read the different types of graphs 
People will be closer to the middle if the bar graphs are closer to each other
2D graphs are better at presenting data to the audience than 3D data.
The experimenter may have been testing hypotheses to determine whether certain factors or interventions have a significant impact on specific outcomes or variables. These hypotheses could be either null (no effect) or alternative (significant effect) statements.
For the null hypothesis, the experimenter may have been testing that hypothesis of 2D and 3D graphs have no difference when it comes to data comparison. For an alternate hypothesis, the experimenter may have tested 3D graphs have less accurate data comparisons when it comes to 2D graphs. 
How many participants will have consistent results? 
How well the average person can correctly read a bar graph
A hypothesis the experimenter might have been testing would be angles have a direct relationship with the perception of size of an image 
They might have been testing if a 2D model is easier to estimate its relative size to another when compared to a 3D model of it. 
A possible hypothesis could be determining if there's a difference in how bar graphs are interpreted by students.
The hypothesis could have been if the graph is 2D the results of verifying what is being shown will be higher than if the graph was 3D.
How will this experiment differ from the one previously studied by Cleveland and Mcgill (1984)
Ho: Participants in the study are able to have equal accuracy in determining bar heights between 2D and 3D graphs. Ho: u2Dgraphs = u3Dgraphs

Ha: Participants in the study are able to accurately determine the bar height difference in 2D graphs compared to 3D graphs. Ha: u2Dgraphs > u3Dgraphs
if males or females tend to be more accurate
How accurate a person is able to read a graph depending on the style.
Younger people are better at estimating relative size ratios compared to older people because their brain functions better.
Can people accurately identify the different levels on 3D bar graphs?
That 2d is preferred over 3d. It cleans up the data presentation. 
If a shape is presented in a 3-D format, then people will underestimate its size.
The experimenter may have been studying how well different age groups can approximate different things based on the charts that were given, although it seemed easy to participate in i do feel like there is a specific purpose behind the study. 
If participants are provided with an example of how to identify the bigger graph, they will be able to apply that knowledge to further questions.
The hypothesis may be that a person can more accurately observe bar graph values when presented in two-dimensions rather than three-dimensions because it is easier to visualize the different bars when looking at the straight on and on one plane. 
When the bars next to the ones looking at the estimation of size difference will be less accurate than when the bars are right next to each other. 
Do people choose the right shape and the right height compared to the other shapes height
The hypothesis from an experiments could have been; 

 

- individuals are more likely to choose the correct answer on a 3-D graph compared to a 2-D graph. 
How does one's perspective change based on the dimensions?
How can different views of graphs change the perspective of which one is smaller than that other?
Can size and variation be viewed equally as well in 3D as they can in 2 D?
The experimenter might have been testing the hypothesis of if students in a statistics class would be able to better distinguish between a 2D graph vs. a 3D graph or if the results would be generally the same as the general population. 
If we put larger bars around a small bar, then the viewer will perceive it as larger then it actually is. 
The hypothesis that the experimenter is testing is if UNL students currently enrolled in STAT 218 will accurately read information presented in various ways as well as to measure their ability to perceive graphics.
How do people understand and perceive questions visibly? Do factors of dimension, color, depth, shapes, or letters influence the perception of size?
The public can more accurately understand data when it is provided to them in a 2-D graph format. 
The experimenter might have been testing people's depth perception. 
3D bar charts are more effective data visualization tools than their 2-dimensional counterpart.
How taking Statistics 218 effects how you can compare two groups.
Do students change their answers when asked the same question over and over?
Individuals have a greater ability to perceive difference in the size of 3-D bar graphs than 2-D 
How accurate humans are at guessing the differences of bar height in graphs
