What critiques do you have of this study and its design? What would have made the study better?
-----
The study doesn't account for discrepancies that are caused to factors other than the difference of a 2d bar vs a 3d bar.
I would have liked to have heard more about the different colors and how that affected how people viewed the bar graphs. I felt like that component really changed my ability to tell differences, especially with the darker colors. It may have been made better if the subjects could have only viewed the physical graphs rather than on the computer or phone. 
The study could have more specifically studied novice graph readers to focus on a more specific group of people. I also feel that this would make for results that would better pertain to the general population.
Don't give so many ratios and combinations, it did make for a confusing study. A little more information to this study would have been better than almost no context
I think that the actual experiment could have asked the participants more about their own experience with the 2D and 3D designs. Whether they personally thought one was harder to understand than the other. We have data to show which one may have been more difficult, but asking opinions of the participant may have changed how we viewed the results. 
I think the darker colors made it difficult to differentiate the bar size comparison which could have influenced the results. I also think a large sample size amongst other people outside of statistics class might allow a more generalized representation of participants and allow for a more accurate outcome.
A notice on the screen that the 3-D models were mobile would have been nice, as I did not realize they were and that may have impacted my estimate and by extension their data. More types of graphs may have been beneficial but I can understand why a smaller sample was easier.
It needs to be clearly stated that you are comparing the smaller bar to the larger of the two bars, not all of the bars on the graph. The first slide in the experiment where it shows you what you will be doing needs to include all the bars just like the experiment does. 
The instructions for the test were a bit confusing - maybe I was just overthinking it. As I've said before, this presentation cleared up a lot of this for me.

 
Some potential critiques and improvements for the study:

Critiques:

* Small sample size.

* Lack of participant diversity.

* Inadequate control of external factors.

* Potential order effects.

* Limited replication.

* Overreliance on subjective judgments.

* Lack of blinding.

* Unclear data analysis.

* Ethical concerns.

* Insufficient discussion of limitations.

Improvements:

* Increase the sample size.

* Include a more diverse group of participants.

* Control external factors.

* Randomize the order of evaluations.

* Replicate the study in different contexts.

* Incorporate objective measures.

* Implement blinding.

* Establish a robust data analysis plan.

* Address ethical considerations.

* Clearly discuss limitations.
Some things I would change would be to make the images a little be more clear to see. I also think this would improve the results of the study. The online experiment was more difficult compared to if you could see the images in person. 
I believe using more graphs from programs that are used everyday like excel would've made the study slightly better. If we used graphs that were most commonly used, we could have a more accurate result to how 2D and 3D perception are different. 
Some critiques I would have are maybe have different studies. Having different studies can have better results. When its repetitive it can get boring and easy to lose track. 
Learning outcomes - Seeing the same ratios across multiple chart types may inadvertently training participants, skewing results. Showing each ratio only once could avoid this. I found myself detecting patterns of ratios with multiple graphs.
I think there could have been a different way for participants to determine how much smaller one bar was compared to the other. From how I see it, I feel like the sliders aren't the most accurate way to describe the difference in size.
Some critiques of this study that I would make would be to make it a little more interesting to participate in, I feel like I had a hard time staying focused on this. To make this better I would have made it shorter for the participants and broadened it to way more people so people have less graphs each but have more answers.
I think being able to use the 3D kit is not exactly relevant because there is no way that universities would be able to provide them for every student. Other than that I think that the study was very well designed and explained. 
I don't have many negative critiques for this study, it appeared that researchers tried to navigate around each limitation that occurred in the Cleveland and McGill experiment. The only critique I would have is in the participation portion, and how the 2D and 3D graphs are set up in order for the participant to look at. I think it would make the study even better and provide better results between analyzing the different graphs if the researchers set it up so that participants looked at a 2D graph and then immediately a 3D graph, back and forth, and so on. It would even be beneficial if they showed the same data in the two different graph types back to back that way researchers could really see how the two different graphs are analyzed and if there is a significant change in 2D to 3D analysis. 
Something that would have made the study better is using numeric values when determining how much larger or smaller a graph is because each person has a different conceptualization of what the distance of the slider means. I think that this would provide more statistically significant results because it will not be categorical and the researchers could actually compare the numbers the participants are choosing. 
I do not really have any critiques, i would say that the study could be better if it were expanded to more than just stat students. I think students with no stats background could be interesting.
Personally after gaining all of the infromation i have now on the study there is nothing to critique. Moreover to make this study better, i believe that when participants are tested they should be monitored. 
I think the study would be better if the sample size included a larger amount of different people. I also think results would be more accurate if it was supervised.
I thought that the study was well put together. When I was doing the experiment, I hadn't yet understood its purpose, and I enjoyed the concept throughout its entirety.  I don't have any critiques or advice to make the study better - I appreciate the attempt of replicating Cleveland and McGill's previous experiment. 
No critiques. I think involving different colorways would be interesting to see if there is any preference change. Would it cause more confusion? 
Though I thought the study was well made and carried out, I feel something differently could've been done regarding the slider for indicating "how much smaller." I'm not sure why but the slider didn't seem like the best option especially when you're trying to get more accurate information. 
Presenting the information to participants either only through kits or only online would make this study better because there would be fewer variables in the participant's perceptions. 
I think if the bar were more noticeably different and easier to compare that would make the study better. I also feel like the wording of it was a little confusing. 
I think that to make the study a little better it could have went over why your answer to the questions impacted the results of the study as well as maybe showed a trend, where if the answers were incorrect, show the most common answer. On top of that, the study could of had better ways at retaining the results rather than a software that could be considered hard to use. 
I might have missed it while reading the instructions but I did not know that you could move the 3D graphs around which would have been nice to do. It would be helpful to maybe bold that in the instructions so the person doing the study remembers it. After watching the presentation I thought the UNL study was put together nicely. It would be interesting if they kept doing it how the data would change from year to year. 
I would say that the researchers could have made the study a little bit less confusing if they would have worded some things a little bit differently. I also think that they could have use something other than the sliding bar to show by how much the bars on the graph differentiated. I could have been overthinking it but it was a little bit confusing to me. 
I think that having all the graphs have different colors might affect the study design. I'm not sure if it was recorded whether people were color blind, because the shading of the graphs might impact results there, as well. I think it would have made this study better to have accounted for information about color-blindness or to have color-blind-friendly colors on all their graphs. 
The only critique I would have for the study is just a bit more clarity. I was not sure at first whether to compare the single bar or compare the whole mass of the two graphs differentiated by letter.
In my personal opinion, the results were a little difficult to understand as someone who doesn't have much experience in statistics. However, I think the presentation was able to give a very basic analysis of the results that allowed me to understand more. 
For the 3-D graphs, it was hard to tell which one was a circle or triangle based on the first look. Also for the 3-D graphs on the computer, the shading and colors used made it visually difficult to tell how much smaller the bar was. What would have made the study better is keeping the graphs the same color, also having less of a shadow when comparing a smaller bar that is next to a larger bar when the observed bars are far away from each other. 
i think the study would have been better if they made the graphs brighter, and more defined so that the subjects could see the graph better. If the graph was larger I think that would help with the online version of the experiment. 
I think this study was good. I like how we went into it not knowing what was being compared so it couldn't have been biased.
I don't really think anything was wrong with the study, they asked questions to get the information they wanted to obtain. I didn't love the way the questions were asked because i was confused at first but eventually got the hang of it.
I think something that could have made this study better is maybe reducing the combinations of ratios that were put out in the study. Less ratios could allow for more people to do the experiment, but not have such overwhelming data to go through in regards to figuring out the hypothesis.
Some critiques I have of this study and its design are the specific way in which they collected sample units. I am not sure that either sampling populations would be representative of an entire population or able to be generalized further. The participatory nature of collecting sample subjects may turn out in an oversampling of one population so there should be a larger and more random way of getting a new sampling population.
