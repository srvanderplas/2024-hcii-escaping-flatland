What components of the experiment are clearer now than they were as a participant? What questions do you still have for the experimenter? Write 3-5 sentences reflecting on the abstract.

The reasoning for all the different bars. I was really confused why there were numerous bars on each side, but that is now much more clear. My question for the experimenters is whether they believe it would make a difference in the results if there was only one bar.
I believed that one of the components was the dimension of the graph. However I also thought that the color was the main component and that was not true. The angle was an obvious component I felt, but then again I wondered if it looked that way because I was using my phone. 
The exam was about perceptual judgement, using the difference between 2D and 3D graphics. This is a different approach than just deciding how much bigger or smaller something is as the participant. A question I have is why we think 3D graphs are harder to perceive than a 2D graph. This seems a bit confusing to me, because they seem to be about the same for me. I also would like to know about the difference between 2D rendered charts compared to a 3D printed chart. Perhaps this is because I took this course online. 
One of the things that make sense to me now is that there is a cut difference between the accuracy of a 3D on 2D chart. It was confusing to see that they read two different totals with the same data so I assumed the 3D was more accurate. Another thing that messed me was that I tried to estimate the results with could've throw off the results. And that could've add to my error in my graph
The scientific question is more clear after reading the extended abstract. I now understand that they wanted to compare differences between 2-dimension, 3-dimension, and printed 3-dimension. They were testing not the correctness, but the perceptual judgment. There was also a formula that they provided for judging how the participant analyzed the bar graphs, and if they were correct provided the formula. The random distribution of ratios also makes sense in that there were 21 different combinations of bar graphs amongst different participants. 
I guessed correctly what the experiment was about so I have very few questions. On question is if we know 2D graphs are easiest to ready why do we try to use the others if it's only for looks. How many people total are used for the experiment. 
The reasoning behind the experiment is clearer, as well as selection of participants, after reading the abstract. I would like to know in more detail the potential implications in data graphics for the visually impaired, and perhaps why 3-D graphs aren't viewed as positively as 2-D graphs if they're hypothetically more effective.
Yes, the components of the experiment are clearer now. The abstract gave us details to what the experiment was about and what the research question is. I now know that the experiment was set up to find how 2D and 3D graphs can affect the perception of a person. The set up for the experiment was explained in the abstract and I have background knowledge to why this experiment was set up in the first place. One question that I still have about the experiment is what is the population that is being observed here. Is it the general population or just college students?
The actual purpose of the experiment, effectiveness of conveying data in 2D vs 3D, is clear er to me now than it was as a participant. I was wondering if other factors influencing perception of 3D vs 2D graphs were considered. Also, if different kinds of data may be better reflected with the respective depths.
The components of the experiment that are clearer now than they were as a participant would be the randomization of the shapes. The goal was to determine the outcome based on 2D compared to 3D images and the differences in the responses. A question I still have for the experimenter would be do the responses change in correlation to the participants age? Do younger adults have better accuracy than older adults? 
Components that are clearer are the which shape is smaller. I say this because at first, it was a little hard to decide. After understanding it was a little easier to understand.
After reading the abstract, the purpose of the experiment is much more clear. The issue of 3D graphs limiting comprehension of data being stated and addressed makes the set-up and objective of the study more clear. My one question would be if there are any plans of presenting this data to educators and could it have some impact on education in the future.
Why we were taking this experiment and what the experimenter was hoping to gain from it is a lot lcearer after reading the Abstract. I would like to know how accurate wer the responses from the students who did the experiment online versus those who took it in class with the extra material. As well as what the results mean overall when applying it to further use. 
I didn't give much thought to how or why the graphs and bar values were presented the way that they were. I realize now that there were specific algorithms used to create the bar charts and select comparison values. The motivation for using 3D printed charts is also clearer since the experiment is testing if 3D printed charts improve accuracy. I'm still curious about the sample size and participant pool demographic information.
The components that are clearer now than they were as a participant are what the experiment was doing. Being able to understand why we were trying to determine which graph was easier to read makes a lot of sense now. I do not think that I have any questions for the experimenter. The abstract was more helpful determining what the results of the study were, and how they were found. 
I believe that the components of this experiment are more clear to a reader than a participant are the methods that were used. Being a reader you get more information about the experiment all at once instead of over an extended amount of time. A question that I still have for the experimenter is if the bar graphs are the same exact size, what effect would that have on the study?
The abstract presents a concise overview of the research, which focuses on the comparison of 3D printed bar charts to their 2D counterparts in terms of conveying numerical information. It effectively references prior studies in the field, establishing a clear context for the research. The choice of keywords and references lends credibility to the work. However, the abstract lacks a clear statement of the study's primary findings or implications, which would help readers understand the significance of the research. In addition, a more detailed explanation of the specific metrics used to assess the "effectiveness" of the charts would provide a clearer understanding of the experiment's goals.
It seems to be a lot more detailed and as a participant it does not feel it needs to be this detailed. I can see more clearly now that it is very important to make information as detailed and as clear as possible so that people other than just yourself can read it. Making it so that even children could read it is important is a sign of good writing. I am still curious how many tries and how long a proper experiment should be and last.
components such as the purpose of the experiment, comparing our answers given on 2D charts to 3D charts and which ones we more accuratly answer. The thought process behind why this experiment is being tested is still a question in my head even though i read the abstract. Also, i was confused in the abstract when they talked about 3D charts and 3D printed charts, what is the difference?
It is clear that the researcher is trying to gage the difference in accuracy between estimating the length of 2D bars and 3D bars. The study design is also clear. My question however is what is the point of knowing this?
After reading on the study, I can better understand the reasoning behind it and the purpose of the experiment. I enjoyed that they tried using similar tactics as that of Cleveland and McGill. I thought it was unique that they had strategically planned out the distance between the two bars that were being assessed throughout the study, as I didn't think it was possible to be that in depth and in such detail. Overall, I am impressed by the experiment. 
After reading the abstract what became more clear was the design process and the math behind the results to interpret the data (i.e., the log error). What also became more clear was the implications of this study and seeing how 3D graphs can sometimes be misleading. One question I would have for the experimenter is why would they need to group two bar charts if the participant is comparing bars that are either in the same group or next to each other.
The purpose of this experiment is much clearer compared to as they were when I was participating. I understand that the researchers are trying to compare the accuracy between reading the differences of the 3D images and 2D images. I understand that the experimenters were testing the effects of visual depth when interpreting 3D data in a 2D setting. It makes sense that 3D graphs are less accurate in a 2D setting because of visual depth issues. A question I still have for the experimenter is whether there was a perceptional difference between 2D, 3D, and 3D printed bar charts?  
The goal of the study is much clearer now, and when I was guessing what the goal was someone who participated in the experiment. Since they are now in the next step of the study in having students in an introductory course participate in the study, how do they plan to generalize their conclusion of how 2D and 3D influence perception? I would like more information on what they mean by kits. If these kits are physical they would have to look at how the physical kits are different than the online version that the stats students are taking. Is that something they took into account. 
Now that I am more familiar with the experiment because I participated in it, I feel that I understand more how the results of the studies were gathered and what kind of work went into creating the experiment. I also feel that I have a better understanding of how the partipants were selected. Somethings I still have questions about is how would the results of this experiment varying if the age range of partipants was increased to people 20 years outside of college. Another thing I am curios about is wether or not the color/ dimension/ view of the graphs play an important role in the partipants responses? 
How they made the graphs and what they were trying to accomplish make more sense now. I like how they had some of the graphs to equal the same number of differences in size. When I was doing the experiment I thought that some of them might be the same, but didn't know for sure. I also like how they want to extend their sample size the next time that they do it because it will make the results more reliable. I should have thought more on the hypothesis because after it was stated in the abstract I was like that makes sense. 
It is much clearer now that I have a better understanding how each graph was prepared and modeled. The in depth description of the 3D printed graph helps me better visualize the model. A question I have is if there are any other color ways that might adjust the data? Grey and white overlay being the primary is a very common and dull color-way in my opinion. 
The components that are clearer now than they were as a participant are how the graphs have been rendered. At first I didn't really know what was going on with the graph and how a 3D version of a graph would look and different than the 2D version. I also didn't really understand what the point of the experiment was but the Future Research Implications section helped me through the reasoning behind the experiment. Overall at first I was a little bit confused as to how this experiment even worked and why anyone would care but after participating in the experiment I would be interested in seeing the results. After participating I understand how it could be hard to see the differences in the two labeled bars on the bar graph based on if it were a 2D or a 3D graph.
After reading the abstract, I was surprised to learn that the subject of the study wasn't the hypothesis I thought it was. Now it's very clear that there's a discrepency between interpreting 3D and 2D graphs/visuals. I am still curious after reading this what the results of the study are based on students feedback. I also want to know if the student results were different then what was expected based on Cleveland/ McGill's study. 
As I participated the experiment had me focused on ratios. I did not think of it in length. I did not know the implications of the experiment as well. I am grateful to understand that studies such as these go on to help others and create solutions to improve the quality of life for those with disabilities.
After reading the extended abstract, I have a better understanding of what actually was being tested and why. From my understanding, the purpose of this experiment was to extend/replicate results from Cleveland and McGill. The study replicates the procedure from the previous study however, they wanted to measure/observe the differences between 2D graphs, 3D digital graphs, and 3D printed graphs. There also appears to be random assignment within the experiment as the graphs and questions were presented in random order; I was initially unsure if questions were randomized or if each participant was given the same questions at the same time. I am curious to see the results of the study and how they were able to measure their collected data.
the abstract offers insights into how participants are instructed and guided through the experiment. It's clear that participants are expected to make quick judgements without external aids and are provided with specific tools to identify. It would be helpful to know more about the size and characteristics of the participant sample, as well as how representative they are of the broader population. The abstract providers a high-level overview of the study, but it doesn't present any quantitative results or findings. 
The components that are clearer now are how the 3-D graph is manipulated, like how the spaces were added between the tiles. What also became clearer was why the researchers would put other bars in between the circle and triangle. The questions I still have are how the results are different when given two bars right next to each other and when they are farther apart. 
I totally overlooked the fact that some of the graphs were different in regards or 3D of 2D, how many bars were present, and if the triangle and circle bars were next to each other of if they were separate. I now understand that the researcher did this on purpose and wanted to test if the position and angle had an affect on how I perceived it. If I could ask the researcher a question I would ask how they plan to use the information regarding the test subject. For example why did they want to know my favorite zoo animal. I wonder if that had an affect on how they used my data.
I understand that the experiment is about the effectiveness/interpretation of 3D bar charts compared to 2D bar charts. I now know they were trying to see if something more tangible like a 3D chart would be easier to understand. However, I question their way of providing the test online - I understood what I was supposed to be doing - but why were there two bar charts (labeled A and B) while only one of the charts had either the circle/triangle I was to focus on? 
It's clearer now as to why I needed to say how much smaller I thought one bar of the graph is compared to another, it's important to understand what a graph is telling you and that different graph types (2D or 3D) can display the same results but look different. Scaling is important when creating graphs, and it can be misleading to the participant or reader if there are discrepancies between graphs that may be displaying the same information. I also understand why using different graph types shows that there are differences in how the data is displayed and how that can make it difficult to determine how the participant takes the information or how they read the data. Discrepancies in graphs can lead to a lack of validity in results, which can be bad for experimenters, so a study like this is important to see how participants read the results from different graphs. Do you think that this type of experiment can be extended to classes or subjects outside of statistics? Are there specific situations when you should use a 2D graph over a 3D graph, or vice versa? Do you think it is easier to judge graphs online or do you think it is better on paper, or is there no major influence for either? 
It is a lot clearer about what the goal was. I didn't know that it had to do with the 2D and 3D charts. When I was doing the experiment, I thought that it just had to do with where I moved the bar, I didn't take into consideration if the graph was 2D or 3D. I want to know what the results were.
Now i understand that they were testing to see if student had an easier time reading 3D or 2D charts. Also comparing them to each other. I would love to know more about why these scientists wanted to put on this experiment in the 1st place. 
Components of the experiment which are clearer now than as a participant would be was in which the variables were presented. Essentially, 2D, 3D, and 3D printed graphs were presented in specific and different ratios for the two bars to be compared with 10 bars in total for each graph. The results of the study could be used to create data graphics for visually impaired individuals. Some questions I still have is how could these results aid in the designing of graphics for the visually impaired or how does the sampling population represent them? 
Some components that are clearer now is why they are doing this experiment. It was to show the difference between 2D and 3D graphs and how they are perceptualize in different environments. Another thing that was clearer is that there are 21 kits of graphs for this experiment which allowed for each combination of the different ratios they used for comparison to be observed. Another thing that was helpful to learn about from the abstract was that they said that research shows that data comparisons are less accurate in a 3D chart than a 2D chart. A question I still have is how did they know what height to use for each bar and each set of bars? Like is there research done that tells us what makes it harder/ easier to visualize height difference in both 2D graphs and 3D graphs?
