What sources of error are involved in this experiment?
-----
Human
Fatigue effect over the course of making many judgements, learning patterns from seeing the same ratios multiple times, possibly difference in eyesight among participants.
There are no line values to help measure it when there is a small difference between the graphs.
People that are guessing
People in the sample misunderstanding directions.
Potential sources of error in this experiment include random error, systematic error, selection bias, measurement error, and experimental design errors. These errors can affect the accuracy and reliability of the results.
Using a 3D graph and a 3D plane was something they planned for because in most previous experiments a 3D graph was used on a 2D plane. 
Circle/triangle 
Angles and sight
The sources of error that are involved in this experiment are the complex shapes, if one has poor vision, or even depth perception it could make this experiment difficult 
Human error since it is the only main contributor, if some one did the experiment without actually looking at the graph and selected random answers which would lead the results to be different overall, but the experimenter could just not use these outliers as they would be rather clear to tell if a person attempted to ruin the results. 
As far as I know, there wasn't much random sampling involved or there may be some bias of sorts. The results may apply for students in STATS 218 here at UNL, but maybe not for other students taking a similar statistics class elsewhere.
Not having explicit directions the experimenter could be confused. 
A source of error that is involved in this experiment could be a participant not understanding the objective of what they are doing. 
There could be an error created because some people might have more experience analyzing graphs than others. There can be errors created when people use the toggle bar in the participation section, some people might be more generous in their answers than others. 
choosing which shape is smaller. someone might rush and completely get the small detail wrong.
It could be confusing for people to know if they are comparing the smaller bar to the larger of the two or the largest on the graph.
The students are not supervised while participating in this experiement.
Since we are doing this study online, we are all participating in this experiment in different environments that could cause personal error. 
Incorrect answers in the online survey results. 
Some people may quickly glance at the graph and incorrectly assign shapes or sizes.
Different sources of errors could include, the thought proccess behind the person taking the survey and whether they understand what the experimanter is trying to research. Also, not being able to monitor the person taking the survey could lead to misleading infromation. 
There are no numeric values on the sliding bar, so choosing the spot on the slider is just an estimate.
Some sources of error could include if the participant is viewing this on a computer or paper. Some computers may appear different than others, as well as different when printed. Other errors may include the color of the bar graphs, and some being more distinguishable than others.  
People are not necessarily taking this survey alone. The bar is not a very accurate way of showing the difference in size. 
how much someone think the bar is smaller or bigger than the other bar. 
A source of error that could have been involved in this experiment was the partipants not being truthful when filling out the consent form or there could have been repeated graphs that an individual was given in their study. 
Sources of error could be regarding a participant's vision or the diagram itself since it's sometimes harder for 3D models to show up correctly on certain pieces of technology.
I thought that the slide bar was a little confusing even after the example. When I was taking the experiment I read the bar as the left end 0% smaller then the further you slid it the closer it was in size to the bigger graph. Someone else who is doing the experiment could interpret the slide bar differently. 

 

Another error that could happen is if the results from online-only are not separated from the ones that have the graphs printed off. 
How colors may have affected viewing; technical error because being viewed on phones; also if the size of the bar graph was small or large, and the way the graph was positioned.
I think that there was probably a lot of human error involved in this experiment. We all perceive things differently and I think this could lead to some very different results in the study. 
Since there's online and in-person results it's not clear how that might effect the experiment. There's also some confounding variables like color and angle of the bar graphs. 
One source of error for this experiment is that it is not conducted in a controlled environment. Students may be working together or not reading the experiment carefully therefore the results may be skewed. 
One source is when the quiz is first started one could compare the whole graph to each other, or interpret it as the individual line that had the shapes. There are two ways that a participant may see how to make the comparisons.
One source of error could be human error when deciding how much smaller the bar is when comparing two different data sets. 
Something that could have gone wrong is people rushing through the experiment, and not taking their time. 
The persons taking the survey?
The sources of error were probably where the line was dragged to because not everyone would put it at the same place.
students could be clicking random things or purposly. failing 
The sampling group may be biased and not represent the entire population if it is only stat 218 students 
There was no numbers on the slider when guessing how much smaller the bar was, it made it hard for me to know if I was accurately putting it in the right place or not.
