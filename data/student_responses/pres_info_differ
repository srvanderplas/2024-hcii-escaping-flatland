How did the information you gained from the components of this project (participation, post-study reflection, extended abstract, presentation) differ?
-----
The presentation really helped me understand what the project was about. I did not know much about the study given the information from other sources.
I was a bit confused in the beginning because I didn't read the instructions well enough. I was considering the difference between the shortest bar (triangle / circle) compared to the tallest bar (not the other shape). So I had to start over. I was focused on the color of the graph more than the dimension. I did notice further along in the experiment that the angles were changing. I did feel as if the dimension was an obvious component as the experiment went on.
The knowledge about what was being experimented on was different. For instance, throughout participation, what was being experimented on remained unclear until reading about the results afterward.
He provided for background information to it and more of a purpose to it as well, rather than just having a group take it randomly.
They gave more depth to the purpose of the experiment for me. As a participant I would say that I was a bit ignorant to purpose as I simply answered the questions rather than inferring the reasoning behind my answers. 
I didn't have much information when participating in this study, which allowed me to complete it unbiased. After reading the abstract and watching the participation, I understood the scientific method behind it, and more about the research question itself.
The information gained during the participation in the study was mostly conjecture, and the same was true for the post-study reflection. The extended abstract primarily covered the methodology of the experiment as well as its inspiration, and the presentation went over the study more broadly but in less detail than the abstract.
The presentation made the experiment much easier to understand because it was made for the public. The two page paper was harder to understand because it was so in depth and mainly for the researchers.
This presentation cleared up a lot of my questions about the study. I wasn't sure if it was about 3D printed objects or 3D graphs in general, but now I know they're seeing if the objects are useful in comparison with 3D graphs. During participation, I understood what I was doing but I was simply confused. During the reflection, I still wasn't sure. Luckily this presentation breaks it down into something I can understand.
Participation gathers real-time, subjective feedback. Post-study reflection provides deeper insights. The extended abstract offers a formal summary, while the presentation conveys findings to a broader audience. Each component serves a unique role in understanding perceptual judgments on 3D printed bars.
When participating in the study I was confused at what I was specifically doing and what the data being collected was. Once I was on the other side of the experiment it made more sense and realized it was about perception. 
Each component of this project explained a different part for the experiment. The participation was to collect data for the experiment while the presentation gave us a breakdown of what the the questionnaire was all about. It also broke down what the results would mean and what the scientific research question was being asked. 
They differed because of the different aspects involved. The information I gained went up and down. Furthermore, the information made more sense after the experiment. 
The experiment itself didn't make it obvious that 2D presentation of a graph distorts the data, which is an interesting perspective to carry when reading different charts, especially bar graphs. I learned this through the extended abstract and presentation, which drastically changed my thought process when reflecting on why each type of graph led me to believe it had that specific ratio on the slider tool.

I gained minimal information from the experiment itself, but the post-experiment activities helped me gain a better understanding of the purpose of the study.
I think that with each module, we gained more and more insight into the study and its purpose. It was almost like this video was the last part of a scavenger hunt to find the purpose and idea behind the study and the other components were like little puzzle pieces.
Being a participant in this study I felt as though I didn't get a lot of background behind this experiment as for the why of it. Post-study reflection I felt as though I got more insight into what this experiment was for. These differed based on the people within the experiment, it's very unlikely that an experiment with a random group of people will be the same.
They all differed in explaining why the results were what they were. The abstract was from the views of the experimenter vs the general public.
Throughout my participation in this experiment, I gained more information on how I examine data given to me in two different graph types, 2D and 3D graphs differences. From the extended abstract I could fully understand why the experiment was designed the way it was. I know now that it was important to start with 2D graphs and then go to studying 3D graph data to see which I had more confidence in analyzing or which I was most accurate with my responses. The presentation was helpful because I was able to gain more information as to why the researchers were studying the difference in how people analyze 2D and 3D graphs. From the presentation, it was interesting to learn that people are able to have better accuracy with their 2D graph responses compared to 3D graph responses. 
Participation: I was confused on the purpose of the study, but understood the directions clearly.

Post study reflection: I was able to guess what the hypothesis and purpose the study was, but i was incorrect.

Extended abstract: I understood that the researchers were trying to gather data on depth perception with 2D and 3D models.

Presentation: I was able to clearly understand how the researchers came to this hypothesis, sampling methods, and results because it was easier to understand rather than reading the abstract. 
each gave no insight or rather a new lense of how to look or go about something. each was important and different. the presentation gave background information, the participation allowed me to try and get hand on, the post study reflection helped reflect on what i really just did and the exteded abstract showed what someone elses thought process might look like.
Within my participation in the testing i had no idea what to think, but as i started to think after i completed it i started to come to the conclusion that they were testing how different peoples judgment are in different age groups. After, i completed the abstract and presentation i found that there was a specific purpose behind the testing, finding what the general public can read more accuratly as far as the different types of graphs. 
I think I gained a bit more information each time. For the participation I did not know any purpose except for the instructions. After the extended abstract and presentation I knew much more about the purpose of this.
As a participant in the study, having no idea what the purpose was at first, I truly enjoyed the experiment. I felt like I was doing a self-challenge to try and accurately determine how much smaller the smaller graph was. Next, I read the extended abstract and appreciated the purpose of the experiment, its history behind it, and the strategies used within the experiment. When doing the post-study reflection, I feel like I got to tie everything together that I had learned so far. Finishing off with the presentation, I feel like everything became full circle and I found interest in the additional information that was given that wasn't in the extended abstract. 
Neither differed, but was able to follow along better in the presentation. 
The participation component provided the least amount of information as it didn't want to give away what the study was about. On the other hand, the extended abstract and presentation gave more information on what was being looked at in the study and how the study was being conducted. 
This presentation goes into a little more depth about the information that was actually placed in front of the participants and how that differed from the studies that they based this one off of. They gave a visual of the kits which was a question that I had from the extended abstract. The abstract cleared up a lot of questions that I had from participating in the study by clarifying what they were looking for. 
Participation and post-study reflection offer a more immersive experience and the extended abstract and presentation focus on sharing the projects essence with others in a structured way. 
The information I gained rom the components of this project differ in a couple of different ways. For example; when I was a participant in the study I was a little bit confused on what the experiment was observing, but after I read the extended abstract and watched the presentation I was keyed in a lot more about the background of this study. I also felt that the post-experiment reflection and the extended abstract differs because the abstract gives you the details and the reflections asks you to inturpert those details. 
The participation was me doing the study and being part of the research. The post-study reflection was nice so that I could reflect on what I thought of the study and made me think about it a little bit more and deeper. The extended abstract was nice so I could see how the study was initially put together and what they wanted to find out. I liked the presentation so I could see how the UNL study differed and what they were trying to accomplish. 
The information that I gained from the components of this project differed a lot in my opinion. At the start of the experiment I was a little bit confused but all of the parts of this experiment and especially the presentation helped me to understand it more.  
I was kind of lost on what information was being gathered by just going blindly into the study, but then by reading the abstract it became more obvious it was about comparing 3D and 2D model accuracy. I really liked the information the presentation added though, because it was easier for me to understand and then I fully understood what the content was about. 
I did not realize the depth of thought that goes into experimental design. As a participant, I had no idea of the depth of the research for this data. Also as I moved through this process it gave me a clearer understanding of the study and its implications. This experiment also helped give me experience in understanding the experiment design process.
I was given little information when presented with the study; I was given directions however I wasn't told why or what was being tested. The post-study reflection allowed my to process all the information I was given up to that point and I was able to draw my own conclusions. The extended abstract gave me more information into the purpose of the study and what the questions guiding the study were however, I was not given any results or further discussion. Similar to the extended abstract, the presentation provided a more in depth analysis into the background of the study as well as the methods. The presentation was easier to understand in my opinion. The presentation also provided the results along with an analysis. 
More information was provided about how the graphs differed from each other. Also, it was clearer to me when they described who participated in the study. Also, from participation not much was said about how the graphs were manipulated from the 3-D and 2-D graphs. The abstract made it clearer how each of the graphs was manipulated from the heights of each bar, how far the triangle and circle were from each other, and how the viewing angle would change. 
When I was participating in the study I felt unaware of what I was looking at, and how the graphs being different from each other probably affected the was I perceived the graphs. After reading the article the researchers put together on how they conducted the experiment I thought about my answers a lot differently, and it made me question my answers. Knowing that they purposely made the graphs all different changes the way I would have looked at them. 
I feel like we got more information as we moved on. That allowed everything to come together and show us why we were completing the experiment. The presentation was different from the aspect because it showed how it was specific to our experiment.
They were all different forms of obtaining the same results, i understood some better than other because of the way that i learn. Some people will benefit from certain forms of learning better than others
As I went throughout each step of this project, I was continuing to learn more information about the study itself. Each aspect helped me learn something about how the experiment was done, or more of the math used to figure out the data given. It also helped me to be able to think about what I did on the experiment to compare to the answers other people gave/ the data that has been collected so far. 
The information I gained from the extended abstract and presentation was certainly more detailed easier to understand. It became more obvious to me as to what I was being tested on and the purpose of the study in the post-study reflection. However, the practice run before the actual experiment test was helpful.
