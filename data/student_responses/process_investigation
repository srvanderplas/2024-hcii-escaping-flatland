In this class, you'll be learning about the process of scientific investigation. What do you think that process looks like, from the perspective of a researcher, compared to what it looks like from the perspective of someone in the general public who is a consumer of scientific results? Write a paragraph (at least 3-5 sentences) about how you think science happens.

The process of scientific investigation probably looks different from how it is consumed in that scientists have to identify a reasonable way to set up an experiment that would answer the posed question. They would also have to break of the components of their experiment to determine the best way to approach the experiment. This would also factor in how to interpret the data that they’ve gotten (ie chi-squared test vs t test).
The process of a scientific investigation involves asking a question. From there, you would conduct whatever experiment you deem necessary to answer that question. From there you can either confirm or deny your hypothesis. Science represents a very wide variety of things.
From the perspective of a researcher you have a list of topics you need to answer like problem identification, data collection, and interpretation, Plus many more. From the perspective of general public you have things like understanding, engagement, and critical thinking to worry about.
rom a researcher's standpoint, the scientific investigation process is a thorough and methodical journey of exploration and discovery. It all starts with forming a research question, creating hypotheses, and designing experiments or studies to test these hypotheses. Researchers meticulously collect and analyze data, often using specialized tools and methods to derive meaningful conclusions. It's a process that demands careful attention to detail, critical thinking, and a commitment to following the scientific method to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings. Researchers also participate in peer review and share their discoveries through publications, conferences, and collaborations with fellow scientists.

On the other hand, for someone in the general public who consumes scientific results, the process appears more simplified. They usually come across scientific information through the media, educational sources, or public communication. The focus is on the end results of scientific research, such as new discoveries, advancements, or practical applications, rather than the intricate steps leading to these outcomes. The general public is presented with the final conclusions and real-world applications of scientific research, which are often presented in a way that's easy to understand. While they benefit from the progress and knowledge generated by scientists, they may not have a deep understanding of the complexities and challenges researchers encounter during their investigative journey.
From the perspective of a researcher, the process of scientific investigation is a complex one. A researcher must be able to set up an experiment and be able to remove any variables that could possibly affect their scientific research question. Researchers set up experiments to answer a question they are asking, and they must remove any variables that could possibly affect the outcome. They must also do background research on the question and gain knowledge about the overall experiment, The general public looks at the scientific investigation as just an experiment happening. They don't really think about possible variables and just look at the end results. 
I feel like the process of scientific investigation is a process where research begins to study. Meaning I think they take a specific approach to the study. I also think that scientific process is used. I think science happens randomly and never planned. 
I think science happens based on curiosity. I think scientific investigation happen because of people question why things happen. The world only works because people question and test the unknown.
From a researcher the process is very laid out step by step when coming up with a hypothesis all the way to the experiment type to analyzing the data received. From a consumer side the process looks a bit odd as were are just going to do the experiment with little to none information about how accurate we might be or what the overall hope of the experiment is for the researcher. It also seems to put pressure on the consumer because we don't fully know what the study if testing for. 
Being a researcher involves such meticulous detail planning, down to refining survey instruments and even following up with study participants. I have a research job on campus, and the amount of hats the primary investigator wears just to ensure that the study is conducted according to standards and regulations is extensive. Research assistants, like myself, write and aim to publish the results for readers to consume. Their role is simply reading the article (sometimes just the abstract and conclusion) and coming up with their own judgment on whether or not they think the results are true or accurate. There is a wide discrepancy in those who take scientific results as fact, and those who are extremely skeptical.
I think scientific investigation will give us a plan for experimentation, from a researcher's perspective this will start by providing a question that needs to be answered and then creating a hypothesis. In comparison to the eye of the public this differs by providing results to the general public. I think that science happens in more ways than can be defined, science isn't one category of something, its discovering things.
I think that scientific investigation would look like gathering data about a certain subject and using it to clarify or answer some hypothesis from the researchers point. From the perspective of someone in the general public, I think that they would only know the hypothesis and then also the results. They would not know the data collection process. So I think that plays into how science happens. Because science covers so many things I think it would be hard to dumb it down to only one explanation. 
From the viewpoint of a researcher, scientific inquiry is a methodical, evidence-based procedure that entails developing hypotheses, carrying out tests, and analyzing data in order to deepen our understanding of the universe. Researchers work together with colleagues, adhere to strict guidelines, and publish their results in specialist publications. On the other hand, science is typically presented to the general public through media or educational channels as simplified, condensed conclusions. The complex labor that goes into conducting research can be obscured, which highlights the significance of good science communication in bridging the knowledge gap between the public and researchers.
first you get a group of people or group of things and gather some information about them, like credentials and important information usually involving something you are looking at. Then you usually split them into groups and observe them regardless of what group they are in and it is important they do not know what group they are apart of. 
Personally, i believe that from a researchers perspective it is interesting to investigate and search for different results. As far as someone in the general public, contributing in an experiment or a study would be cool because you would be able to see where you line up amongst other participants, the results would be extremely interesting from the general public side of things. With that, science can be interpreted in different ways from different people, some may think science happens in a lab with test tubes and explosions with different chemicals, but in reality science happens in everyday life through trial and error to seek a purposeful answer. 
I think scientific investigation as a researcher looks like having a question. Then formulating a hypothesis and conducting an experiment using proper scientific practices. This might look like to the general public new information concerning a proposed question.
All scientific investigations start with someone asking a question and someone attempting to answer it. The process from the prospective of the researcher is going to look much more in depth, they with think about the smaller aspects the general public would often not even consider. The general public will most likely only want the answer to the question, a few of the details and how true it is. I myself have often skimmed over research online just to find the short yes or no answer. 
Science and more specifically experiments always have a why. Maybe not an answer to a research question, but a reason why there is one in the first place. Keeping in mind that science wants to build knowledge to the general world. There is question and the goal is to answer and revise. 
I think the process looks like conducting a sample group, formulating research questions, analyzing data, and looking at the outcome- from a researcher. From a perspective of someone to the general public, I believe it's about following a series of rules if you are in the experimental part, but as one in the control aspect it is about going about a day-to-day life. These consumers will then be carefully observed by the researcher in order to provide data of the study. 
I think that a researcher has to do a lot more work than someone from the general public. They have to come up with ideas, research beforehand, design the experiment appropriately, make sure nothing goes wrong, and a bunch of other things. Scientific research for the general public typically consists of looking for a paper, or more often an article in a magazine or online, and seeing if the information in that article backs up their idea. The general public doesn't have to perform scientific experiments on the regular.
The process of scientific investigation from the inside looks a lot different than from the outside. From the insider's perspective, one must come up with a question, a hypothesis, decide how to partake the study, choose variables, and have an entire strategic plan in regards of going about the study. Then, one must form a readable way to record results and finalize the study. From an outsider's view, the study is complete and one is able to read and understand the study and data for one's benefit and knowledge. It is much easier to be on the outside, but could be more rewarding from the inside. 
I think that the process of a researcher looks very different from the consumer of the results. That is because the researcher is the one who makes an observation, asks questions, researches the background of the topic, form a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and then draw conclusions from that. This process is rigorous and takes someone who will consider any and all aspects in order to provide the most valid and reliable results. On the other hand, the consumers are just absorbing the results that are being communicated to them from the researcher, and it makes sense, but the consumer would not been able to reach these conclusions like the researcher did. The researcher provides understanding for the consumer. 
From the perspective of a researcher, I think it is imperative to investigate using a plausible hypothesis. A researcher should be interested in obtaining evidence that can widely support a research question rather than obtaining evidence and presenting it in such a way that highlights a conclusion one would wish to be true. For a scientist, it is much deeper than how someone in the general public may analyze scientific results. For the average person, without doing much investigating or understanding the depth of scientific research, it is easy to take results at face value. Therefore, when a researcher is conducting a scientific investigation, it should be presented with high confidence and intellect, as it is easy for someone with limited knowledge of the subject may be inclined to believe results regardless of the strength of evidence. 
The process of scientific investigation for a researcher may be longer and more complex compared to that from the general public. For a researcher, more steps may be involved to conduct the experiment, making the overall process more meticulous. Additionally, it's more likely that more questions/factors would be considered by the researchers themselves. From the perspective of the general public, the process may be not as complex and more straightforward. They may not have as active of a role in the actual researching portion with researchers, but have a key role in helping understanding and interpreting results.
Scientific investigation for a researcher is a long and intense process. It often includes years of studying your topic and doing experiments to collect data. A lot of the time they have to try many different ways to get enough of the right data to prove or disprove their hypothesis. In the eye of the public a lot of the depth can be lost. They do not always see the deep research that comes from the researcher and only see the published study and think that was what most of the work was. 
From the perspective of a researcher, the process of scientific investigation is methodical and iterative journey filled with curiosity, inquiry, and rigorous methodology. For someone in the general public, they encounter the end results of this process through news, articles, or publications. People can appreciate the importance but they not be involved in the nuances of data collection, and experimentation. 
From the perspective of a researcher, science involves a rigorous and lengthy process of hypothesis generation, experiment design, data collection, analysis, and peer-reviewed publication, marked by objectivity and collaboration. For the general public consuming scientific results, the process seems simplified, often encountering science through condensed news reports or documentaries. They see the polished end product but may not grasp the complexities and constant trial and error of the research process. This can lead to a perception that science provides definitive answers, whereas it's a long, ongoing, and sometimes uncertain process.
From the perspective of the researcher, I think it would be stressful to get everything in line. They first have to come up with a question to be answered so the then the research can be done, the hypothesis can be made, the experiment can be done to collect data, after all of that the conclusion can be made. The perspective of the general public would look a lot different because they don't see everything that plays into the research and the time that it takes. To an outside person reading the results it could look very simple. 
I think the process of scientific investigation has to do with a lot of observations from the perspective of the researcher. Looking into something from a research perspective takes a lot of planning and observation of the research question being asked. Comparing that to someone in the general public who is a consumer of scientific results is much different. I believe that someone in the general public would just look at the results or be told the results without really truly knowing a lot about what happened, whereas the researcher did a lot more observing and can understand the investigation a lot more. That being said I think that if a person of the general public truly wanted to understand more about the investigation they could if they were able to observe more like the researcher.
I think that the process of scientific investigation looks like gathering multiple pieces of data from different experiments and analyzing the results of gathering that data. For a researcher I think they are the ones who are setting up these experiments based on the certain things they are curios about. From the general public that is the consumer of the results I think that they are the ones that are retaining this new information and using it in their daily lives. 
I think that science usually begins with a hypothesis. Researchers will follow formatting and write out something about if ___ happens then ____ will happen. They then conduct an experimental or observational study and gather data to support or contradict their hypothesis. This part can be quite technical depending on the subject you are studying. The problem usually occurs when communicating those results to the general public, because sometimes researchers use a lot of technical jargon that the average person doesn't understand. Most people don't want to read the long research paper or they're behind a paywall, so there's also an issue of gatekeeping science to a certain community (often one of privilege and/or wealth). Reporters usually get flack for misreporting only part of a study, for example: White wine could extend your lifespan. This all comes down to a science literacy issue and the fact that some scientific language is inaccessible. 
The process of scientific investigation begins with inquiry and the formation of a hypothesis. From there the hypothesis is tested via various experiment designs suited for the specific research topic. Results are then analyzed and a discussion/conclusion can be made. As a researchers, it is easier to understand the amount of work types of biases that may play a role in results. However, a member of the general public may not be aware what to look for.
From a researcher's perspective, I believe researchers are always looking for a deeper understanding. Researchers focus on the why and how, while consumers seem to focus on the what. Today with the technological advances we have made in recent years, I believe that data is collected much faster and much more data is captured with our digital footprints.
The difference between the researcher and the general public is that the general public would look at the results of the research. The researcher will make the observation first and then make a hypothesis. They then will test the hypothesis and make their conclusion based on the results that are given to them. The general public may make an observation, but they aren't testing anything. 
I think that science happens when a question is brought up. Science happens when there is a "how" that can be explored and maybe answered. Science happens sometimes just out of curiosity. but most of the time I think it happens to solve a problem or an issue that faces our community like a medical issue.
I think the process of scientific investigation relies on the general public being unaware of some parts of the experiment. The people involved in the experiment must not be biased or have any outside persuasion during the experiment. To make sure that the experiment is successful, I think that the researcher should try to keep the general public in the dark about what they are necessarily testing so that their result can be the most accurate. Sometimes if the test subjects know that they are being watched on something specific their behaviors might changed which could ruin the experiment. The researcher's point of view will be entirely different than the test subjects. Science happens by recording and observing data provided by control and experimental groups. 
The process of scientific investigation involves observing something (for example: why does X happen?), then forming a hypothesis ("X happens because Y and Z."). From there, we experiment difference scenarios by changing variables, and then we gather results and determine if our hypothesis is accepted or rejected. We repeat the experiment with new variables after accepting or rejecting to either further confirm our hypothesis, or determine a new one. 
A researcher needs to look at what groups they are going to be studying and how the scientific results are going to be beneficial to the public and how the public is going to perceive the results. Science is important to be replicable as well, so the researcher needs to make sure that the experiment can be recreated by someone in the public or even another scientist. It's important to do the 6 steps of the scientific method for a researcher to accurately create, design, collect, and analyze the data of the experiment. A consumer of scientific results is mostly looking at how the results impact the public or even them individually. The consumer mostly looks at results and what those results stand for, whereas a researcher analyzes results from science in order to see how the outcome impacts science and the public and see how the science will impact future experiments of groups. 
I think that from a researchers point of view they have to make observations, form a hypothesis, and conduct the experiment on an individual. I think that to a consumer of scientific results, they wouldn't think about all the steps that went into it. They would look at the results but not at anything else. I think science happens by performing a variety of steps.
The process of scientific study is seen from the viewpoint of a researcher as a thorough and rigorous journey characterized by curiosity, critical thinking, and deliberate experimentation. Researchers create experiments to test their hypotheses based on knowledge already known. They gather information, perform statistical analyses on it, and then come to findings that further our understanding of science. Additionally, researchers participate in peer review and communicate their discoveries to the scientific community through cooperation, publications, and conferences. The procedure may seem more simplified to a member of the general public who uses scientific findings. They frequently only meet science in the form of published studies or news articles, which may not fully convey the difficulties and intricacies of the research process. Consumers of scientific information must critically assess sources and understand that the road to scientific discovery is frequently paved with incremental steps, uncertainty, and revisions because they depend on the credibility of the scientific community and the media to accurately communicate findings.

 
For a researcher there is obviously more understanding of scientific results. They can look at it from a deeper perspective and understanding as they know more about the concepts being talked about. They can analyze the study procedures and strength of evidence to formulate informed conclusions. For someone in the general public I feel they would be more easily influenced. There could even be false information which they are convinced to believe. 
From the perspective of a researcher, I think that the process of scientific investigation is much more intense. I think that a researcher has to do much more thinking about the experiment they are going to do, and think of all the possibilities that could happen (good or bad). Whereas a consumer of the scientific results has all of the information handed to them in a way that they can choose what to do with that new information. Researchers have a very specific process and questions they have to answer within their experiment whereas consumers of this research are able to form their own opinions on what they choose to believe based on the results of what the experiment has already given them.
