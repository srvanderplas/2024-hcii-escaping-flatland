What variables were examined? For each variable, identify whether it was quantitative or categorical.
-----
Which one was smaller, categorical

Which one was larger by what amount, quantitative 
Independent: chart type (categorical)

Dependent: accuracy of ratio judgment (quantitative) 
Accuracy: quantitative 

weather they chose a square or triangle: categorical

How fast they took to take the survey: quantitative  
size - categorical

amount of size difference - quantitative
One variable was the type of graph presented (categorical) and the other was people’s perception of the graph (categorical).
The variables examined were:

* Number of close friends (quantitative).

* Gender  (categorical).
The variables that were examined were what type of chart, 2D or 3D, and this was categorical. The also examined the variable of how accurately the participant was able to compare the difference in data. This was quantitative. 
Categorical 
Types of graphs used. Categorical 
Variables would be if the graph is smaller or larger- categorical 
Which bar is bigger triangle or circle, categorical

How much smaller is the bar than the other bar, quantitative
* which bar was smaller (categorical)

* by how much smaller was the bar compared to the larger one (quantitative)
2D, 3D and 3D printed. Determining the size. These would be quantitative because it would be a numerical value.
3D or 2D printed - categorical

answers given - quantitative

 
Explanatory variable: is the difference between 2D and 3D graph types, this is categorical. 

Response variable: Which graph type has more accurate results/responses, this is quantitative. 
shape which is categorical and length of difference which is quantitative
Response variable- how accurate the reading of the graph is 

Explanatory variable- The type of graph used

Both are quantitive
Age range - Quantitive

Gender - Categorical

Accuracy of estimating size ratios - Quantitive
The first variable is deciding which graph is smaller and this is categorical because we are choosing between two options. The second variable is deciding how much smaller the smaller bar on the graph is, which is quantitative because we are determining an amount. 
2d or 3d height categorical

about how much smaller each bar was, quantatative
The variables examined were proportional size and visual representation. Proportional size is quantitative and visual representation is categorical.
Age: Quantitive 

Favorite zoo animal: Categorial 

 
Which bar graph was smaller (categorical)

How much smaller or larger the graph was to the bigger graph (categorical)
Which bar was smaller- categorical. Proportion of how much smaller the bar was to the larger bar-quantitative. 
If the correct bar was identified as shorter - categorical

The difference in size for the two bars - quantitative
What were the two bars: Categorical 

How much bigger and smaller the bar is: Quantitative
the variables examined were: 

* the 2-D graphs: catagorical 

* the 3-D graphs catagorical 

* wether the partipants chose the correct answer (circle or triangle was bigger) catagorical 
The variables that were examined were if either the triangle or circle bars were smaller (categorical) and then determining how small said bar was in comparison to the other (quantitative).
Which circle is bigger - categorical

How much bigger is the larger graph from the other - quantitative 
2D or 3D bar graph - categorical

Color of graph- categorical

Position of graph - categorical 

Size of graph - categorical
The variable examined were weather the graph was 2D or 3D which is categorical.
I think it was categorical whether the participant identified the correct smaller bar and then quantitative how close the slider was to the actual size of the bar. 
One variable is how many graphics a student was able to successfully perceive - this variable is qualitative.

Another variable is how well students were able to read information from charts and how far off they were from the actual measurement- this variable is also qualitative.
color- categorical

dimension-categorical

size-quantitative

understanding-categorical

 
The variables were which graph was smaller and how much smaller the bar is compared to the larger one. 

Deciding which graph is smaller is categorical.

How much smaller the bar is, would be quantitative. 
One variable that was examined was the difference in size of the graph bars which is quantitative. Another variable that is examined is how close to the right answer the test taker is which would categorical. 
Variable 1: The smaller chart - categorical.

Variable 2: How much smaller one chart is compared to another - quantitative.
The variables were which was taller and that was categorical and where you slide the bar and that was quantitative.
whether or not student got it right is categorical

the amount of student that changed their answers for the same questions is quantitative 
which bar was larger which is categorical and how much smaller the smaller bar was which is quantitative 
the variables were:

which bar was perceived as smaller: categorical 

how much smaller the bar was to the taller one: quantitative
