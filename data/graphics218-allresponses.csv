It all starts with forming a research question, creating hypotheses, and designing experiments or studies to test these hypotheses. Researchers meticulously collect and analyze data, often using specialized tools and methods to derive meaningful conclusions. It's a process that demands careful attention to detail, critical thinking, and a commitment to following the scientific method to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings. Researchers also participate in peer review and share their discoveries through publications, conferences, and collaborations with fellow scientists.

On the other hand, for someone in the general public who consumes scientific results, the process appears more simplified. They usually come across scientific information through the media, educational sources, or public communication. The focus is on the end results of scientific research, such as new discoveries, advancements, or practical applications, rather than the intricate steps leading to these outcomes. The general public is presented with the final conclusions and real-world applications of scientific research, which are often presented in a way that's easy to understand. While they benefit from the progress and knowledge generated by scientists, they may not have a deep understanding of the complexities and challenges researchers encounter during their investigative journey.","brokering-flixweeds-luminesce-roughriders","To test how much people perceive the percentage of something to smaller ","People will be closer to the middle if the bar graphs are closer to each other","People that are guessing","size - categorical

This is a different approach than just deciding how much bigger or smaller something is as the participant. A question I have is why we think 3D graphs are harder to perceive than a 2D graph. This seems a bit confusing to me, because they seem to be about the same for me. I also would like to know about the difference between 2D rendered charts compared to a 3D printed chart. Perhaps this is because I took this course online. ","They gave more depth to the purpose of the experiment for me. As a participant I would say that I was a bit ignorant to purpose as I simply answered the questions rather than inferring the reasoning behind my answers. ","The difference between the ratios and whether the graphs were adjacent or separated. I think this is because it is a deeper question than the original research question. It is another variable rather than the answer to our research question. ","I think that the actual experiment could have asked the participants more about their own experience with the 2D and 3D designs. Whether they personally thought one was harder to understand than the other. We have data to show which one may have been more difficult, but asking opinions of the participant may have changed how we viewed the results. ","An extended abstract typically provides a more comprehensive written overview of the study, including details on the research question, methodology, data collection, analysis, and results. It often includes references and citations to related literature, which can help in assessing the study's context and the soundness of the research design. This format allows for a more in-depth and critical examination of the study's methodology and the quality of the data and analysis.

Presentations, on the other hand, are often limited by time constraints and may focus more on summarizing key findings and implications, potentially leaving out some of the finer details of the research design. They are valuable for providing a quick overview and for engaging an audience, but they may not offer the same level of depth and scrutiny as an extended abstract.

So, if the goal is to determine whether an experiment was well designed, the extended abstract is usually the better choice for a more comprehensive and detailed assessment of the research methodology and its rigor. However, combining both the presentation and the extended abstract can provide a more complete understanding of the study."

The problem usually occurs when communicating those results to the general public, because sometimes researchers use a lot of technical jargon that the average person doesn't understand. Most people don't want to read the long research paper or they're behind a paywall, so there's also an issue of gatekeeping science to a certain community (often one of privilege and/or wealth).

The consumer mostly looks at results and what those results stand for, whereas a researcher analyzes results from science in order to see how the outcome impacts science and the public and see how the science will impact future experiments of groups. ","lays-calutron-trichology-twentieths","To measure the difference in how well participants analyze data presented in 2D graphs compared to 3D graphs. ","Ho: Participants in the study are able to have equal accuracy in determining bar heights between 2D and 3D graphs.

Ha: Participants in the study are able to accurately determine the bar height difference in 2D graphs compared to 3D graphs. Ha: u2Dgraphs > u3Dgraphs","There could be an error created because some people might have more experience analyzing graphs than others. There can be errors created when people use the toggle bar in the participation section, some people might be more generous in their answers than others. ","Explanatory variable: is the difference between 2D and 3D graph types, this is categorical. 

Response variable: Which graph type has more accurate results/responses, this is quantitative. ","I think that there is randomization but not a control group in my opinion, because there isn't one group that is left alone or not studied. There is randomization in how people were shown the graph types and random sampling because the survey was put out to students, but they were not required to answer. The random sampling does make it so that others outside of Statistics 218 can take it as well. This helps enlarge the generalizability of the study.","It's clearer now as to why I needed to say how much smaller I thought one bar of the graph is compared to another, it's important to understand what a graph is telling you and that different graph types (2D or 3D) can display the same results but look different. Scaling is important when creating graphs, and it can be misleading to the participant or reader if there are discrepancies between graphs that may be displaying the same information. I also understand why using different graph types shows that there are differences in how the data is displayed and how that can make it difficult to determine how the participant takes the information or how they read the data. Discrepancies in graphs can lead to a lack of validity in results, which can be bad for experimenters, so a study like this is important to see how participants read the results from different graphs. Do you think that this type of experiment can be extended to classes or subjects outside of statistics? Are there specific situations when you should use a 2D graph over a 3D graph, or vice versa? Do you think it is easier to judge graphs online or do you think it is better on paper, or is there no major influence for either? ","Throughout my participation in this experiment, I gained more information on how I examine data given to me in two different graph types, 2D and 3D graphs differences. From the extended abstract I could fully understand why the experiment was designed the way it was. I know now that it was important to start with 2D graphs and then go to studying 3D graph data to see which I had more confidence in analyzing or which I was most accurate with my responses. The presentation was helpful because I was able to gain more information as to why the researchers were studying the difference in how people analyze 2D and 3D graphs. From the presentation, it was interesting to learn that people are able to have better accuracy with their 2D graph responses compared to 3D graph responses. ","I think that in the presentation the ""background on 3D graphics"" was emphasized more compared to the abstract. I think it is heavily emphasized in the presentation because it is likely easier to analyze present results with possible 3D graph limitations. In the abstract the researchers talk about limitations that can occur within the study, but more on limitations that needed to be corrected from the Cleveland and McGill study. ","I don't have many negative critiques for this study, it appeared that researchers tried to navigate around each limitation that occurred in the Cleveland and McGill experiment. The only critique I would have is in the participation portion, and how the 2D and 3D graphs are set up in order for the participant to look at. I think it would make the study even better and provide better results between analyzing the different graphs if the researchers set it up so that participants looked at a 2D graph and then immediately a 3D graph, back and forth, and so on. It would even be beneficial if they showed the same data in the two different graph types back to back that way researchers could really see how the two different graphs are analyzed and if there is a significant change in 2D to 3D analysis. ","I personally would prefer the extended abstract because it provides exactly what the experiment is trying to study, with extra information on how it connects to the Cleveland and McGill experiment, and how the limitations are being met. I think the extended abstract is better for determining whether the experiment is well-designed. While the presentation provides an overview of 3D background and scale, I believe that the extended abstract provides more in-depth and beneficial information for the participant to accurately navigate around the limitations that the study may have between 2D and 3D graphs. "

The only suggestion I have, as mentioned in my other responses, is to show how to work with 3D models. Putting participants with no experience with 3D models can be hard to get accurate results. I would suggest putting some notes or a short video on how to move the models. This will allow participants to more accurately show if 3D models are less than 2D models. I would also suggest expanding this experiment further than just statistics students. This is a very niche group and for more unbiased results, use students of UNL. ","I would suggest the presentation.

Therefore, they want to replicate a study to take a closer look into understanding them when compared to regular 2D charts. It shows that this study intends to address a problem that many people are having with interpreting information that is 2D and 3D and, therefore, make it easier to comprehend. 

 ","I gained more in-depth information about the equations they used and how they were calculated. The results were then shown, which explained predictions and how they felt about the results. For example they were a little surprised that one of the studies did not show more of a difference. ","It explained how they ran into the issue of having 42 treatment combinations and how they were able to make it more manageable by having each subject receive 5 of the 7. I think it was mentioned in the video because they explained the study more in-depth. ","A critique I have is when taking the quiz and choosing a value that best represents the graph it was difficult using a slider. Therefore I would think having people manually put the number in rather than using the scale would have been a better design of the study. ","I would have preferred the presentation since it showed visuals and it was talked about how the kits looked like which the abstract did not.

After a hypothesis is formed I believe research experiments and studies are conducted. To be a credible scientific investigation, the results need to be reviewed and aligned with many other scientists. Then, I believe follow-up research should be conducted to strengthen the credibility of the conclusion, which leads to accepting or rejecting the original hypothesis. I think this process that I previously described is how a researcher would see the scientific investigation process, however to the general public I think that most people would assume it is more simple than that. I also think the general public does not wait to have all the results or for other reviews to agree with the findings of an experiment before they believe it. I think most of the general public hears science jargon, sees an established/what they think is a credible source, and some statistics and believes it almost 100%. ","67969-98091-29155-87170","I think the purpose of the experiment was to see how accurately we can estimate the percentages and heights of the bars/blocks based on each other's heights.

* Bars could be missing

* People who have glasses/visual impairments

 ","I don't think that there were control groups present because this study would be hard to have a control group. They would have to still participate in some way, but they wouldn't be estimating the heights of the blocks/bars so I don't think it would be effective or applicable to use a control group. I do believe there was randomization within the experiment because we were put into different groups randomly by giving us a different package filled with differently sized bars/blocks and maybe an online presentation as well. ","After reading the extended abstract of this experiment, most parts of the experiment are a lot more clear now. For example, just even the research question for this experiment is more clear, making the way it is conducted make more sense as well. When previously reflecting on the experiment we had to guess the research question and what was being measured, it was very hard to determine the reason and hypothesis for this experiment without any context expecting participating. As a participant, it was somewhat confusing as to why they had some questions online versus some questions that pertained to 3D objects held in their hands. One question I still have for the experimenter is why they think the data comparisons for 3D charts are worse than 2D charts. ","During the participation, I did not gain much information, especially because we were not presented with the scientific question or any of the hypotheses. The post-study reflection and extended abstract provided similar information to me, we were able to understand what we participated in and why they conducted the experiment the way they did. Finally, the presentation gave me the most information, which gave me info on all of the experiments, and a very good overview of the entire experiment. ","I think some things that were emphasized in this presentation that weren't emphasized in the abstract are the potential errors or problems within the experiment as well as the actual ""math"" or statistic information within the experiment. I also think that in the presentation they included much more about the aspect that some of the participants in the experiment were students of statistics versus those who were not. ","I think that this study and its design could have been better with the way that the 3D-printed models were printed. Some of them had weird bumps or errors in their prints, which could affect the results. The way we were able to view the 2D online models could have been different like it would be more helpful to zoom in or move it around more. ","I think I would prefer to hear about this study only using the extended abstract because I prefer the way the information that was in the extended abstract was presented. It included a lot of information that was included in the presentation could also be found in the extended abstract. I think that the extended abstract would also be the best for determining whether the experiment was well designed because it explained some of the errors or potential errors and where the study should be furthered. "

It was most likely designed this way due to the limiting factors of it being done with college students who are typically busy and have tight schedules to adhere to which makes it difficult to perform a controlled study type of experiment. ","Most of the components of the experiment are much clearer now than they were when I was a participant; considering there were basically zero instructions and no explanations given concerning the characteristics of the experiment and/or what the purpose of it was. While I was participating, I was trying to assess and evaluate what the possible purpose or goal is of the experiment. The most I came up with was that they were evaluating how well participants are able to intuitively measure or amateurly assess the height of something in a 3d bar graph and then compare it to other structures and sizes in terms of relativity. It's clearer now after reading the abstract that the study focuses on evaluating how individuals perceive and judge bar charts created using 3D printing technology. After reading this and understanding the entire purpose of the experiment, I would say honestly, my assessment wasn't too off.

Further questions I have would be possibly be, ""what the potential implications of this finding would have for fields that utilize data visualization techniques?"" ","Each part of this study contributes differently to the understanding and communication of the experiments findings. 

1) Participation- this was the direct interaction with the 3D bar charts, which allowed me first-hand experience and insights with the experiment; specifically, on its clarity and effectiveness. 

2) Post-Study Reflection- this was my reflection on what I experienced after interacting with the 3D bar charts.

3) Extended Abstract- this was my understanding of the study's purpose, methods, goals, key findings, and final conclusions.

4) Presentation- Final interpretations and results of study.","The presentation emphasized design choices, explaining the rationale behind methodological decisions. Also discussed limitations and other aspects in way more depth. ","I don't think the instructions were very clear, and I didn't really understand what I was doing when I was doing it, and I think that could have impacted the reliability of my answers. Therefore, clearer and more defined instructions and understanding of goals for the study would make it better in my opinion. ","Presentation would be my preference.

Often the slider was too finicky and wouldn't allow me to settle on the number I wanted to respond with.

From the public's point of view, scientific research might seem like an exciting journey of discovery and solution-finding.

However, I still have questions regarding the specific methodologies used for data collection and analysis, as well as the implications of the findings for real-world applications. Reflecting on the abstract, I find it intriguing how the study aims to investigate the effects of different chart designs on perceptual judgments in the context of 3D bar charts.

Additionally, the presenter provided more detailed explanations of the methodology and results compared to what was presented in the abstract. This emphasis on visuals and detailed explanations in the presentation likely aimed to engage the audience and provide a clearer understanding of the study's complexities and implications.","One critique of the study design is the lack of a control group, which limits the ability to make causal inferences about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

At first, I thought the experimenters were testing to see if 3D models gave a more accurate result, but after watching the presentation I now know they were testing to see if 2D models have more accurate results. ","One thing that I think was more emphasized in the presentation was the study design, and how the treatment combinations were set up. I think this is because for this specific experiment, there were originally 42 treatment combinations, which would not have been ideal for the subjects. ","I think having a very clear introduction into a little bit of what the research is, would help.

After conducting research, they will analyze the data to draw conclusions and hopefully find successful results. After this, they then publish their findings no matter the results. The results should be published even if it was not the data you were hoping for because then other researchers can analyze it and draw conclusions of their own. Conversely, from the perspective of someone in the general public who is a consumer of scientific results, it may seem like a way easier/ simplified version.

I feel that the slider would give a wide range of answer from your participants so how to do draw a correlation from that? Why not just give like four answer choices and we click which one we think it is closest to, that way you get more consistent data to look at. ","The participation piece came first so I did not fully understand the goal of this study and what exactly I was supposed to be doing.

There most likely is a series of preliminary experiments and testing to find the best way to gather and calculate the data. Then the results are analyzed and summarized into findings that are sent out for review by peers in their field. Then any shortfalls brought up by their peers are reexamined and the cycle starts over again until your peers agree that you've done your due diligence and have solid findings backed by scientific proof.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

 ","The presentation emphasized the five different types of graphs and the point of studying them more. It also emphasized the purpose of the kits and how they were being observed in the study.

One question I would have for the researcher is if they believe the interactable 3D visualizations provided digitally will be any more effective than non interactable digital 3D visualizations, as I suspect they will be at most equally as ineffective if not more so due to the complexities of interacting with 3D objects through a 2D screen.","Aspects such as the history of 3D graphics and the fact that studies have show them to be somewhat less effective at conveying information about data than 2D graphics were left out of the initial debrief we received as participants. This is likely because any information such as this being provided at the outset could skew participants' perception of material in the study and lead to a compromise in the data they produce.","The presentation made the purpose of the study and what it aimed to do in challenging the results of studies that had shown that 3D modes of data presentation are ineffective much more clear. It is important to obscure some of this information at the outset in order to prevent introducing bias into the minds of participants. The abstract serves to present the information participants need in order to play a role in the study in the most neutral fashion as to not introduce extra variables to the study that would confound the results it produces.","The digital portion of the study, particular manipulating the 3D graphics on a screen as well as interacting with the sliders used to log perceived size of the bars was somewhat clunky to interact with. I initially began going through the study on my phone but it had too many issues trying to navigate through it and switched to a computer which was somewhat better. Perhaps specifically controlling for the devices that participants use could help decrease variation introduced by differing screen sizes and formatting troubles. ","The presentation made me feel more interested in the study and invested in it's goals, however the abstract is likely a better show of the study as it should be presented to participants and various other viewers in order to prevent introducing bias caused by too much inside information regarding how the efficacy of 3D graphics has been assessed in the past."

This investigation will hopefully allow them to better understand how or why something works in a certain way. After the researcher has completed an investigation, a consumer of scientific readings can use it. Someone of the general public could have a similar question to the research without the ability to perform an investigation. However, since a researcher has already done an investigation and shared their findings, the consumer can use that information to help them understand their question.","20863-02374-50669-40893","To evaluate whether or not people can read graphs with confidence and accuracy. ","Can STAT 218 students accurately read and identify bar graphs to digest information. ","No numerical data given on the graphs or distance marks to gauge quantity. ","Variables being examined were the different bar graph models, categorical.","Randomization of the bar graph models for each student, a control group could have been one bag of models. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This process is iterative, with researchers revising and refining their hypotheses and methods based on the data and insights gained. Ultimately, the findings are shared with the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications, contributing to the collective body of knowledge and informing future research. On the other hand, from the perspective of someone in the general public who is a consumer of scientific results, the process may appear more straightforward and linear. Consumers often encounter science as a series of established facts and conclusions presented in news articles, documentaries, or educational materials.","04963-32045-92313-22125","To see how well students in Stats 218 can understand and visualize graphs. ","Students in Stats 218 will have a better understanding of graphs than students not in Stats 218.","Some students may have not even tried to do the experiment well.   ","Stats 218 students - categorical

Researchers adhere to strict procedures and frequently work together with other researchers to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of their discoveries. Public consumption of scientific data frequently involves coming across discoveries through media sources, which have a tendency to sensationalize or oversimplify intricate study findings. This may cause a disconnect between the public's understanding of scientific certainty and the process's complexity.
